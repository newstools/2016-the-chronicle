Ms Gwatipedza who was the Town Clerk for Redcliff Municipality and former Harare Provincial Magistrate Mr Chikwekwe were appointed three weeks ago.The two, according to the chairperson of the commission running the affairs of the city, Mr Tsunga Mhangami started work on Monday.Mr Mhangami said Ms Gwatipedza and Mr Chikwekwe were appointed on November 17 after they were successful in interviews conducted two months ago. In line with appointments by the Local Government Board, Ms Gwatipedza and Mr Chikwekwe have commenced work and we hope they bring with them a lot of experience to change around fortunes of this city, said Mr Mhangami.Ms Gwatipedza s appointment follows the dismissal of Mr Daniel Matawu in July this year over allegations of incompetence and maladministration.Mr Matawu was suspended together with the entire council leading to the setting up of the commission which is running affairs of the local authority in the absence of a full council.On the other hand, Mr Chikwekwe becomes the new chamber secretary after the post fell vacant following the dismissal of Mr Richard Masinire in 2010 over allegations of nepotism.However, Mr Masinire s matter is still to be concluded at the Supreme Court after he challenged his dismissal.@pchitumba1.
