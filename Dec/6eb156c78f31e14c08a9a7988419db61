Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter FOREIGN currency receipts from tobacco since the beginning of the year are close to reaching $1 billion after 160,5 million kilogrammes of the golden leaf valued $914 million have been exported.

As at December 16, about 80 173 farmers had registered to grow tobacco in the 2016/17 cropping season while 13 914 were new growers.The area that had been put under tobacco for the 2016/17 farming season was 55 885 hectares.Tobacco is grown in seven provinces namely: Mashonaland West, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East, Manicaland, Masvingo, Midlands and Matabeleland North, which is slowly venturing into the sector with three farmers having so far registered to grow the crop this season.Since the country started using multiple foreign currencies in 2009, the tobacco industry has been one of the fastest to recover from the economic meltdown of the past decade. Many communal farmers have been abandoning other cash crops such as cotton for tobacco due to the favorable producer prices offered.Tobacco is one of Zimbabwe s major agricultural exports.@okazunga
