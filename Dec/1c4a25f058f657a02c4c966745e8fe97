A beast sponsored by Sizinda South Beer Garden and Sizinda Bottle Store is the first prize while the second placed team will walk away with two goats. The third placed team will take home a sheep and the fourth placed team walks away with a goat. The losing quarter-finalists (four teams of two players) will each win two chickens. The best ladies team will win kitchen ware, said BDSL secretary Edgar Dzingai.The BSDL in conjunction with the tournament sponsors have asked the Sizinda and Tshabalala suburbs business community to give back to the less privileged. As part of our social responsibility programme we have requested a department in the Bulawayo City Council that deals with social services to identify three less privileged families whom we will donate grocery hampers to, added Dzingai.The participation fee is pegged at $10 for a pair of players.@RaymondJaravaza
