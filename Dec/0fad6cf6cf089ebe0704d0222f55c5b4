Pokello poses for a picture with schoolchildren after the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe pageant recentlyIt appears Pokello Nare is living it up without her famed Ghanaian hubby Elikem Kurmodzie. Usually, Pokello is not the one to shy away from the public gaze especially when in tow with her tailor hubby. But of late, she has been out and about with friends plus her shoes.Her loneliness has fuelled speculation that the celebrity couple could be going through issues as she has been spotted at high profile shows without her better half.The reality show starlet was seen taking selfies at the recently held Miss Tourism Zimbabwe minus Elikem before she showed up at the Watora Mari Concert at the HICC at the weekend by herself. At Miss Tourism, she clearly had so much free time as she after the show, spent more than three hours taking pictures with fans by the Rainbow Tower s foyer.While things were sizzling on stage at the Watora Mari Concert where Jah Prayzah shared the stage with Diamond Platnumz, Pokello, who was among the VVIPs cut a lone figure and looked a bit low.As if that is not enough, Pokello was recently captured holidaying with her two children Tristan and Nathan, alas without Elikem, raising a lot of eyebrows.Gemnation understands that the couple, lovingly called Polikem from Big Brother Africa reality series, has been living miles apart for quite some time now. This comes as no surprise as Pokello, after the couple wedded customarily, made it clear that she was not up to relocating to Ghana. It seems Elikem is also not willing to leave his country to be based in Zimbabwe thereby leaving the two with no option but to stay apart.Efforts to get hold of the two lovers who have a child together Tristan were fruitless.
