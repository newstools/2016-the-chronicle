A few days ago, South Africa celebrated 20 years of the adoption of its Constitution. In 1989, the Harare declaration was adopted.

If they (private media) do not get those stories, they won&#8217;t have stories to report on and fold.14:21: We do not have to use newspapers to settle scores.

Some say they don&#8217;t want vaMugabe, but if you say so what do you want to be done as an individual. Some says we no longer want Pres Mugabe. Since you are saying so, what do you suggest should be done? It doesn&#8217;t matter who you are. Whether you are a woman, war veteran or ex-detainee, you should know how things are done. Leadership within the party comes with election &#8211; President Mugabe.14:07: We also have got to have peace and unity and this must begin with us. There is a new culture of indiscipline in the party by some of the members who are here. They do what they want. There is even contempt and arrogance tumwe twacho hanzi VaMugabe hatichivade, zvino zvausasavade wati zvoitwa seiko iwe pachezvako..it doesn t matter kuti uri ani. Whether you are a former detainee or a veteran or a member with no standing in the party you should always know how things are done.

Then we know there is some measure of satisfaction and happiness among our people.14:02: Despite the drought we have been able to feed our people and we continue the task of ensuring that none dies of hunger.

There is no doubt about that. In fact very strong. We have had all our opponents frustrated.13:54: If we look at the party from each every angle of one of us, shall we then say we have met and discussed. All these collated views must in the final analysis reconcile and find consolidation, expression and oneness in our resolutions, resolutions which will guide us in the year to come13:51: Apart from discussing the economy, our conference will look at the state of the party. Especially the year gone by. Whilst different organs of the party occasionally meet to review, it is a forum like this one which offers holistic introspection. We must be able to look at the party from above and from below and also side ways. Provinces and districts have have organs which made resolutions which they have brought here.13:48: As delegates we expected to.actively debate so we contribute towards the country&#8217;s economic development. We anticipate robust, frank and informed presentations and discussions. Apart from discussing the economy, our conference will look at the state of the party.
