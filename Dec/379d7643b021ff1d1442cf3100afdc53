Auxilia Katongomara, Chronicle Reporter THE Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development is inviting highly qualified people to submit applications to be considered as members of the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) council. The university has been operating without a council since the dissolution of an interim one chaired by Ambassador Zenzo Nsimbi last month.In a statement, the Higher Education Ministry said highly qualified people interested to be members of the council should have applied by December 30. The Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development is calling for expression of interest from the public for the appointment to the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) Council whose composition consists of highly qualified persons from different fields, reads the statement. The mandate of the National University of Science and Technology is the advancement of knowledge with a special bias towards the diffusion and extension of science and technology. The ministry said interested candidates must have knowledge and experience relevant to Nust s mandate and must be committed to the sustainable development of Zimbabwe. Be committed to the transformation and growth of the Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology development sector, driven by science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) and be consistently available for the quarterly meetings, reads the statement.The absence of a council at Nust has allegedly delayed the appointment of a new vice chancellor as it has to make recommendations to the Higher Education Ministry.Four academics professors Mqhele Dlodlo, Moses John Chimbari and Kuzvinetsa Peter Dzvimbo and Dr Gatsha Mazithulela were interviewed in August to fill the post, but results are yet to be announced.The Nust vice chancellor s post fell vacant following the expiry of Prof Lindela Ndlovu s term in October last year. Prof Ndlovu died a few weeks later. @AuxiliaK
