 Tanaka Mrewa, Court Reporter A 21-YEAR OLD Bulawayo man allegedly stabbed a 20-year-old woman with a broken bottle after she rejected his love proposal at a local night club. Thabo Moyo pleaded guilty to assaulting Lindani Moyo when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Batanai Tuwe on Friday. Mr Tuwe convicted him and remanded him in custody to today for sentence. “This court will never condone such behaviour especially violence against women. Men like you who take advantage of their vulnerability to abuse them deserve to be punished,” Mr Tuwe blasted. Moyo’s father disrupted the court proceedings as he pleaded with the court to remand him out of custody. “Your Worship, he is just a boy. He gave in to the influence of alcohol. Please let me take him home with me, I will look after him,” pleaded the father. Representing the state, Mr Leonard Chile, told the court that on Thursday last week at 3AM Moyo got angry after his love proposal was turned down. “The complainant rejected the accused’s love proposal and he got angry. He stabbed the complainant once on the right arm. “According to a medical report, the complainant sustained a deep cut that may cause a permanent injury or disfigurement,” he said. @tannytkay.
