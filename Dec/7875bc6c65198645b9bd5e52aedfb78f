Richard Muponde, Gwanda Correspondent YOUTH, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Minister Patrick Zhuwao would be in Gwanda today to officially open the Matabeleland South provincial youth business expo. The ministry said in a statement that the gathering is meant to showcase products from budding entrepreneurs and establishing linkages with the formal businesses.Provincial youth development officer, Mr Elphas Siziba, said the expo was a marketing strategy by the Government to build an inclusive economic base with a bias on businesses run by the youth. I urge youths to be part of the expo as it will improve their business skills and help them explore other market linkages. This is an approach that enables youths in business to interface with other formal business entities that are already productive. This will help them contribute towards the growth of the country s economy, said Mr Siziba.He said the expo will expose the youths to potential funders and grow their businesses.Many youths from the province s seven districts have already registered for participation.@richardmuponde
