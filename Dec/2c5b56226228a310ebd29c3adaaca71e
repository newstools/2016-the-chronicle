I am happy with the win although the guys did not perform the way we expected. The pitch was a little bumpy and if we were in a different pitch we would have won the match by four goals or more. Our opponents were not in the game so we should have done better than this. What is however pleasing is that we won the match so it s a good result for us, said Sibanda.ZRP Bulawayo coach, Rodgers Ndlovu was happy with his team s performance. I m happy with how we defended. When you look at our game we had very few shots at goal as our strikers were not aggressive upfront. We will go and work on our mistakes and hope to do better in the final against Bosso 90, said Ndlovu.The winner of the tournament will take home $2 400 with the runners-up pocketing $1 500.Amagagasi and ZPC Hwange got $700 each for reaching the semi-final stage.@khumzallen
