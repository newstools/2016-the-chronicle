I want to encourage the &#8216;golden boys&#8217; to keep working hard and to remain focused till they develop into world class talents who can play in European leagues, and most importantly who can graduate into the senior national team, said ChiyangwaThe current Young Warriors surpassed the previous Under-17 team that finished as runners-up to Zambia in 2014 when Zimbabwe hosted the Games in Bulawayo.It was a different story for the girls soccer side as they lost all their matches against Angola, Namibia and South Africa.However, they proceeded to the semi-finals after the round-robin phase since there were only four countries competing and lost 4-0 to South Africa.
