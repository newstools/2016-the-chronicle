Wayne JamesBongani Ndlovu, Sports Correspondent BULAWAYO Metropolitan Tuskers cricket team coach Wayne James says he backs his team to post competitive totals and defend them during the next domestic season. Speaking ahead of his charges Logan Cup match against Rhinos on Saturday at Queens Sports Club, James backed his batsmen to post competitive totals and challenge for the Logan Cup title and other competitions.Knowing fully well that games are won and lost with the bat, Tuskers opening batsmen will be expected to lead from the front. We re hoping that we post very competitive totals from our batsmen. Unfortunately some of them have been away on national duty and they should be joining us anytime this week. The likes of Brian Chari, Richman Mutumbami, Tafara Mupariwa, Sean Williams and Craig Ervine will be with us. However, Ervine won t be available for the first match as he s off to an early Christmas holiday, said James.The former national Under-19 coach also expressed a vote of confidence on his bowling attack who he described as the back bone of the team. We re pinning our hopes on the seam attack which has always been our strength and the boys have been working really hard in terms of training, said James in a video on the Tuskers Franchise Facebook page.The seamers that James has to his exposal are Christopher Mpofu, Njabulo Papa Ncube and Thabo Mboyi with spinners such as captain John Nyumbu and seasoned campaigner Keith Dabengwa also in his pool of bowlers.James appealed to fans to come in their numbers and support the team during their home matches. We look forward to fans coming out in their numbers to support the team. We shall strive to reclaim the Logan cup and also do well in the T20 and 50 over game where we were very short in our results last year, said James.@bonganinkunzi.
