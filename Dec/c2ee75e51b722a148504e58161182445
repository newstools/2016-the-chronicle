Ms Elizabeth NdlovuAuxilia Katongomara, Chronicle Reporter MPILO Central Hospital has offered to conduct a free surgical operation on a woman from Entumbane who last week said she was living in perpetual pain following a botched operation two years ago at the institution. The crucial operation has been scheduled for today.Ms Elizabeth Ndlovu (38) has developed a strange looking bulge on her tummy after the emergency operation conducted on her following a miscarriage.She told The Chronicle last week that the bulge causes her excruciating pain which she has been living with since the operation.Ms Ndlovu told The Chronicle yesterday: They called me and I went to the hospital last week. On the day that I went there my blood pressure was very high so they could not operate on me. They told me to come for the operation, if my blood pressure is okay, they will re-operate on me. Mpilo Central Hospital s acting public relations officer Matron Sibusisiwe Ndlovu confirmed that the woman had been attended to by doctors. They told her to come on December 21 then we will hear what the doctors have to say, said Matron Ndlovu.She encouraged people who have undergone surgical operations at Mpilo to undergo reviews, even when they do not have money.Ms Ndlovu says she was four months pregnant when her brother kicked her in the stomach resulting in the miscarriage. I was rushed to hospital after realising that I was bleeding and doctors said the baby had moved into the fallopian tubes therefore I had to undergo an emergency operation, she said.The soft spoken woman says she is unable to fend for her two children as she used to do part time jobs around the suburb.Last week, Mpilo acting clinical director, Dr Xolani Ndlovu said surgical operations patients are given a review date to assess whether there are any complications to avoid immediate or long term effects. He said no patient is turned away from the hospital and advised Ms Ndlovu to go to the nearest clinic to get a referral letter to Mpilo for further treatment.@AuxiliaK
