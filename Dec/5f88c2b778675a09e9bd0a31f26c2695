Hwange FC playersTobias Mandoreba in Hwange HWANGE FC s disappointing performance in the 2016 season has jolted them into establishing a Wankie Football Association (Wafa) junior league targeting U-14 and U-17s which kicks off in February next year and taking place in all the town s villages. Chipangano blew hot and cold in the just-ended Castle Lager Premier league campaign which saw them remain deeply entangled in the web of relegation until the very end of the race.Hwange club administrator Khumbulani Mbano confirmed the latest development aimed at identifying and nurturing players for the senior team. We have decided it s time we seriously embark on a vibrant junior development within Hwange like was the case in the yesteryear when the town had the popular Wafa league.The name is deliberate as we want to revoke the sweet memories of that previous set up. This league will not in any way compete with Zifa DivisionTwo league but licences will be processed. Besides, participation in junior development is a practical requirement of Club Licencing System which demands for individual clubs to invest in junior development, he said.The league in which birth certificates and school records will be used, will run in villages namely Lwendulu, Madumabisa, Makwika, Cinderella and Lusumbani although Railways and Mpumalanga have also shown keen interest. The first preparatory meeting with various partners in Hwange s football fraternity was held on Monday to set the ball rolling.In an interview, Hwange soccer legend Amos Rendo, a product of the old Wafa league which had two divisions, came out in full support for the junior league.Popular teams back then which illuminated the scene included Hotspurs FC, Kabwe Warriors, Giant Killers, Rufaro Rovers, Lwendulu United and Iwisa.The league ran for close to four decades until the birth of Zifa Matabeleland North in 1997, churning out stars like Tywman Ncube, Barton Mwalukuka, Isaac Phiri, Joseph Chimao, Skevah Phiri, Austin Ncube, late David Dhidhidhi Khumalo, Rodger Sibanda, Kakoma Kayonga, late Christopher Yoyo Tshuma, Philemon Nyathi and late Masauso BandaThe later generation had notable names like Method Mwanjali, Fabian Zulu, Walter Tshuma, Salim Milazi, Mailos Phiri, Jabulani Ngwenya, Chenjerayi Dube and Witness Munkuli, who all formed the nucleus of a formidable Hwange outfit which was difficult to beat especially at home.
