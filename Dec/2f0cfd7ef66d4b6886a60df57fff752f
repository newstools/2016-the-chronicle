Minister Joseph MadeRichard Muponde, Gwanda Correspondent VILLAGERS in Gwanda have started receiving inputs under the Presidential Inputs Scheme to kickstart the farming season. Gwanda Acting District Administrator Mr Judge Dube yesterday told Gwanda Rural District Development members during a meeting that the inputs were in place, but appealed to Government departments to second staff to speed up the distribution process as food aid was also being distributed. Please this is a serious appeal to all departments who are in the Drought Relief Committee especially government departments. There s a lack of your participation in the distribution programmes leaving the whole process to social welfare and DA s office said Mr Dube. Note that now we also have Presidential inputs which must also be distributed at the same time. We are in short of at least 10 people for the 15-16 December distribution schedule. People in three wards in Gwanda benefited yesterday and those in six other wards are expected to get their inputs today and tomorrow.The Presidential Inputs Scheme is expected to benefit 800 000 households countrywide.Recently, Agriculture Mechanisation and Irrigation Development Minister Dr Joseph Made said farmers benefiting from inputs under the Presidential Scheme have an option to either get 10 kilogrammes of maize seed or 5kg of small grains.Dr Made said cotton inputs to cover 400 000 hectares had also been availed under the scheme. @richardmuponde
