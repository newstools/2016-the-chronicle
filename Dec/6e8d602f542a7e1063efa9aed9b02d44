 Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief A SENIOR MDC-T official Tongai Matutu was on Friday hauled before a Gweru magistrate for allegedly failing to pay $11 500 for his child’s upkeep. He appeared before Ms Judith Taruvinga facing a charge of defaulting in paying maintenance from January 2014 to June 2015. Matutu of 773 Adlyn Road, Westgate, Harare, pleaded not guilty to the charge and was remanded out of custody on $50 bail to 5 January. Ms Taruvinga also ordered Matutu not to interfere with the state witness. In his defence, Matutu said: “I am pleading not guilty because this is not the first time that I have been in this court over this same matter. “I was in this court on October 8, 2015 when I was disputing the order, which was not by consent because I never attended the court. “I have also been paying for the upkeep of my child and the last time I paid was two months ago when I paid $150.” Prosecutor Miss Senzeni Maphosa told the court that the complainant in the matter is Tendai Makura of Kwekwe who is Matutu’s ex-wife. “On June 4, 2012, and at Gweru Civil Court, Tongai Matutu was ordered to pay the sum of $300 per month and $250 quarterly as maintenance in respect of his minor child. “The accused then failed or ignored to comply with the court order and did not pay anything between January 2014  and June 2015,” she said. Ms Maphosa said total maintenance arrears is $11 500. @pchitumba1
