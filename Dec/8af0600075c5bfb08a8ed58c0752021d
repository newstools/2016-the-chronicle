Nyakale who was in Plumtree at the weekend for a family fun day at Maqhawe Pre-School said he believed artistes had to be fully committed towards their work before thinking of money. As an actor, I believe that I should be fully committed and give my art my all. For each role that I play, whether in a movie, soapie or drama, my performance has to be on point so that I don t short-change viewers, said Nyakale.He said he was fully committed to working on the soapie Generations as he does not want to have too much on his plate. At the moment, I ve an acting role in Generations and that s my main focus. I don t want to venture into other projects, lest my attention gets divided. I m passionate about the arts which to me are a craft more important than the salary. I do need the extra money, but I ve to do my work to the utmost then the money will follow, he said.He said he planned to broaden his career with time, but only after completing his role in the Generations soapie. There will come a time for me to expand my career and I will grab the opportunity, but for now my focus is on helping establish the Generations: The Legacy empire. The soapie is a number one hit at the moment and I don t want to lose focus. The actor who was in Zimbabwe for the first time said he had plans to frequent the country more and work with established artistes as well as inspire up-and-coming artistes. As an artiste, your wealth isn t in the money you make, but the love and appreciation you get from fans. I hope to inspire a number of youngsters from Zimbabwe so that several years from now when they recall, they see me as their icon, said Nyakale.@DubeMatutu
