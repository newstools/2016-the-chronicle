The new business has already created 30 jobs for locals, management said.Representatives of tour operators as well as players in the tourism industry in Victoria Falls witnessed the official opening of the branch at Total Service Station along Livingstone way on Monday.KFC Victoria Falls manager Mr Taurai Vaki said the other five branches are all in Harare, with plans underway to open one in Bulawayo, which was shut down a few years ago.He said the business now boasts of 1 000 outlets in Africa. We have five outlets in Harare and now we have also managed to open this branch in Victoria Falls as we expand our business, he said.
