Fresh from scooping an MTV Africa Music Video listeners choice award, Jah Prayzah, is not turning back as he really has his eyes set on conquering Africa. And with Maphorisa the man behind hit tracks Soweto Baby and DJ Tira s S funa Abo Chomi on the beat music followers are guaranteed nothing but the best.Prayzah s collaboration with Tanzania s Diamond Platnumz definitely put him on the continent s map and now, if done correctly, the Mafikizolo collabo will likely increase his fan base, even internationally.Locally, Jah Prayzah has done his part as he commands a full house at most local shows where he performs, especially in Bulawayo where his preferred venue Amphitheatre has at all times, proved too small for his fast growing fan base.The artiste who was in South Africa for the better part of the week working on the single, has assured fans to brace for yet another international hit after party anthem Watora Mari which featured Diamond Platnumz and is likely the track that earned him recognition from MTV. When you work with such amazing, renowned African legends, you can be sure it s definitely going to be good! Watch out for Musoja featuring Mafikizolo masoja, katirikubika kanopisa (we re recording a hot track), posted Jah Prayzah on his Facebook fan page.Mafikizolo s Nhlanhla Nciza also posted a photo of her with Jah Prayzah and her partner Theo Kgosinkwe and simply captioned it: Yes #KeDizembaBoss but we work nonetheless. In studio with Zimbabwean legend, Jah Prayzah, making nothing but the best sounds. Bulawayo music lovers will likely be the first to sample the track at the Kalawa Homecoming party on December 27 because Jah Prayzah is one of the headline acts.This is however not the first time that Jah Prayzah has collaborated with a SA group as he has a song Tenga Doro in which he featured Uhuru.The song however was not properly marketed and did not get much airplay.
