Jonathan NdlovuRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE stage is set for the annual Jonah Football Tournament which starts today and ends tomorrow at Nyabane in Bulilima. South Africa-based businessman Jonathan Ndlovu, who is in the construction industry and has also been bankrolling primary schools tournaments in Bulilima, has set aside R20 000 as prize money for the tournament.Eight teams, Kombani FC, Nyabane Azzuri, Nyabane, Hlangulani, Plumtree Chiefs, Bangani, Manda and Marula will battle it out in the competition. Everything is set for the tournament and even people in Plumtree are really looking forward to this competition. The tournament will be played on a round robin format. On Christmas Day we will have the former players who are based in Bulawayo play an exhibition game against a Plumtree select before the final. The main purpose of this tournament besides bringing people together to celebrate Christmas is to provide a platform for some of the talented players from Plumtree to expose their talent. Like I said before, the community of Plumtree wants a team that will play in a Zifa registered league and we want to use this competition to identify players who will form part of that squad, Ndlovu said.Some of the former players invited for the tournament include active coaches, who will help the Plumtree community scout for the best players that will be selected for the border-town s team set to compete in a Zifa registered league.Ex-Zimbabwe international Hebert Dick, who had a playing stint in Poland, Bosso legend Dazzy Kapenya, the former national team midfield trio of Johannes Ngodzo, Ronald Sibanda and Joel Luphahla, Ackim Muganyi as well as Gift Lunga Jr are expected to grace the Nyabane tournament. @ZililoR
