Thousands march against abortion, homosexualityLilongwe Malawian churches have reportedly held a march against alleged plans by government to legalise homosexuality and abortion in the country. According to The Times, thousands turned up for the march, which was organised under the banner Citizen March for Life and Family, and was spearheaded by the Episcopal Conference of Malawi (ECM) and the Evangelical Association of Malawi (EAM).The churches had reportedly been advocating for abortion to be allowed only under certain circumstances.The churches said that human life begins at conception and therefore abortion should not be permitted .Nyasa Times, however, quoted the country s information minister Malisen Ndau as denying reports that the government was planning on introducing pro-abortion laws . The truth of the matter is that the Law Commission has developed a report and made recommendations to government to adopt a new law on abortion. Currently, the law on abortion is governed by the Penal Code. Sections 149, 150, 151 and 243 of the Penal Code prohibit termination of pregnancy except where the life of the mother is threatened. This is the status of the law, Ndau was cited as saying.Abortion was currently punishable by at least 14 years behind bars in the southern African country. AFP
