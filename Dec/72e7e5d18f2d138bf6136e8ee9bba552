Patrick Chitumba/ Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporters POLICE are now investigating a double murder after the cousin of a woman whose room was doused with petrol and set on fire by her ex- lover in Gweru last Friday, died on Tuesday. Ms Cynthia Hlabangana, not Nancy Sibanda as earlier reported, died at Parirenyatwa hospital on Sunday after she succumbed to the burns she suffered in the horrific attack in Ascot suburb.Sibanda died at the same hospital..Their attacker, Garikayi Zvamada Tabaringa (43) was allegedly miffed when Hlabangana decided to end their affair.Midlands provincial police spokesperson Inspector Joel Goko confirmed the passing on of the two women yesterday.He said Tabaringa and his alleged accomplice, Itai Manyoka (34), had been taken for indications at the scene of the crime at number 343 Fusire Road. I can confirm that two women who suffered burns after Tabaringa poured petrol into a room in which they were sleeping and set it alight have died. One died on Sunday and the other one yesterday, said Insp Goko. Police investigations are underway. It is our appeal that people preserve life and seek a third party like church leaders, the police and community leaders when they have misunderstanding rather than resorting to violence, he said.There was drama yesterday at the scene as armed anti-riot police officers cordoned off Fusire Road for indications to go on smoothly.Tabaringa allegedly broke a window and poured nine litres of petrol into the room where the two deceased were sleeping before setting the room on fire at around 2 AM.He allegedly suspected that Hlabangana was having sex with a rival suitor.Neighbours said they heard him shouting that he was going to kill his slut around midnight.Yesterday, Hlabangana s aunt Ms Sithembile Chireza said the family was devastated by the horrific deaths. We are crushed as a family. We had just made arrangements for Cynthia s body to be transported from Harare for burial in Gambiza Village in Chiwundura communa lands when we received the bad news that Nancy had also died, said Ms Chireza.She said Hlabangana was buried yesterday and Sibanda will be buried today in the same village.@pchitumba1@winnie-masara
