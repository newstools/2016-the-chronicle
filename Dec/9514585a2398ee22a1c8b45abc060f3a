The girl who had remained sleeping screamed but Mukozho was undeterred and struck her on the chest. Sensing more danger, the girl fled but collapsed about 100 metres from the homestead. The boy rushed to inform a neighbour Mr Dambudzo Janyure (40) who came to the scene and found the victims in pools of blood but Mukozho had disappeared, said Mr Moyo.&nbsp;
