Minister KasukuwereWalter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent THE Zanu-PF leadership in Masvingo Province has roped in Politburo members as campaigning for the Bikita West by-election slated for January 21, 2017 gathers momentum. The seat fell vacant following the incarceration of the incumbent national assembly member Munyaradzi Kereke for raping his 11-year-old niece.Kereke was in July sentenced to 14 years in jail but four years were suspended for five years on condition of good behaviour. Six candidates filed their papers at the nomination court which sat at Masvingo Magistrates Court last week.The candidates are Cde Beauty Chabaya of Zanu-PF, Mr Kudakwashe Gopo (ZimPF), Mr Madock Chivasa (National Constitutional Assembly), Heya Shoko (Independent), Mr Terence Tanyaradzwa Makumbo (Progressive Democrats for Zimbabwe) and Mr Innocent Muzvimbiri (Independent).Zanu-PF acting provincial chairman Cde Amasa Nhenjana said the party is so determined to win the vacant seat that it has invited Politburo members to support Cde Chabaya. We are geared up for the polls. Work on the ground has intensified and we have engaged Politburo members like national political commissar Cde Saviour Kasukuwere and Cde Josiah Hungwe to assist in the campaign as the seat has created a lot of interest from our opposition counterparts with some standing as independents. We have upped the tempo and campaigning is in full swing as we speak, said Cde Nhenjana.He said the party has come of age adding that the leadership in the province is approaching the by-election differently in view of the Norton by-election defeat at the hands of an independent candidate Mr Temba Mliswa. Let me make it clear, we are campaigning peacefully contrary to the falsehoods peddled by some local provincial papers that portrayed the party as a violent party planning to unleash violence in Bikita. We are a peaceful party and anyone caught inciting violence is not part of us. We have derived our commitment from Chimanimani West where the Zanu PF candidate Cde Matsikenyere won resoundingly in the by election held last week, Cde Nhenjana said.The Chimanimani West seat was left vacant after Engineer Munacho Mutezo was expelled for fanning factionalism.Cde Nokuthula Matsikenyere polled 11 446 votes with second placed independent candidate Mr Edmore Mtetwa getting 3 018 votes. Mr Peter Gudyanga of PDZ managed a paltry 183 votes while Mr Pesanai Musakaruka of NCA garnered 171 votes.@walterbmswazie2
