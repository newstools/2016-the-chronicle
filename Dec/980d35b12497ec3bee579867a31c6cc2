Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter A ZIMBABWE Revenue Authority (Zimra) official was allegedly caught on closed-circuit television (CCTV) collecting R50 bribe money from a traveller at Beitbridge Border Post on Monday. Shingirai Maereka, a Zimra revenue collection officer was arrested for abuse of office after a surveillance team spotted him on camera taking the bribe at around 8 AM.Matabeleland South Police spokesperson, Inspector Philisani Ndebele said: I can confirm we have received a report on that matter which is now subjudice. A source at the border said Maereka was operating from the revenue collection desk where he was assessing duty payments. Instead of working out duty for travellers, Maereka was seen taking money from a traveller and giving him rebate where it was not deserved. R50 was found on him during the time of arrest and he is assisting police with investigations to check if there is no extra money hidden elsewhere, said the source.Sources at the border said they suspect the surveillance team had received a tip-off from other officers to monitor Maereka resulting in his arrest.A $600 000 security upgrade at Beitbridge Border Post is fast paying dividends as corrupt Zimra, immigration and police officers have already been arrested after being caught on CCTV collecting bribes.The Government secured the equipment, which also includes lie detector machines, to curb corruption at the border post and ensure maximum revenue collection.Since the introduction of CCTVs, eight people including two immigration officers and six police details have been arrested.Recently, the Department of Immigration redeployed 157 officers from ports of entry countrywide as part of measures to curb corruption.Among those transferred were 26 officers from Beitbridge border post.@winnie-masara
