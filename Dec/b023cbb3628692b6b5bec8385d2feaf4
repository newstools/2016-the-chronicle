Value Gas, a national LP gas retailing company that also has interest in petrol and diesel distribution throughout the country, donated more than 30 high quality golf T-shirts at a brief ceremony held at the company premises in Belmont yesterday. I must confess that I knew little about darts before I heard about Archers darts club who made me realise that darts is a good sport with lots of discipline too. It was then that we decided after discussions with the team, to partner with them. For us it is part of our corporate social responsibility and we hope our relationship with Archers will grow from strength to strength, said Value Gas managing director Maurice Masike.He said the company will continue to play an active role in communities that give them the business.Speaking after receiving the donation, Archers non playing captain and football icon, Ernest Maphepha Sibanda said they will forever remain indebted to Value Gas for their kind gesture and promised to win the Kwekwe championship for them. We want to pay back Value Gas by bringing the Champion of Champions trophy to Bulawayo. We won our local league and Archers made history by becoming the first club in the country to win the league title without a loss, said Sibanda.All the T-shirts are inscribed with team members names.There was an emotional moment when a T-shirt bearing the name of the late football icon Willard Mashinkila Khumalo was paraded by the sponsors.The late legendary Highlanders and Warriors great, who passed on last year, was a member of Archers darts club.Other football icons who are members of the club are Chicken Inn coach Rahman Gumbo, legendary juniors coach Ali Baba Dube and Zifa vice president Omega Sibanda.@Skhumoyo2000
