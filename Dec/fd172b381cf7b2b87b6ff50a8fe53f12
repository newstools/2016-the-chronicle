Johannes NgodzoSports Reporter BANTU Rovers have lifted the suspensions of two members of their technical team, including head coach Johannes Ngodzo and three players, who were under investigation for various offences last month. Ngodzo had been accused of going AWOL, while senior players Zephaniah Ngodzo, Lindelani Ncube and Lenience Mpofu were facing charges of plotting to influence their teammates to embark on industrial action over outstanding bonuses.Team manager Wonder Mpofu was said to have been present when the players allegedly conspired to strike.Rovers general manager Wilbert Sibanda confirmed that the quintet had been cleared and was back at work. All the five are back at work after being cleared. They are training with the rest of the squad as we wait to go into our off-season, said Sibanda.Rovers are the Southern Region Division One Soccer League champions and have been keeping their squad in camp awaiting the outcome of the Zifa/PSL relegation and promotion impasse.Zifa and the PSL are bickering over how many teams to promote into the topflight, with the football governing body agitating for four, while the league wants just two.In 2015, the Zifa council agreed that two teams would be promoted from its four regional leagues after promotional play-offs, but changed tune last month and demanded that four be promoted and two relegated.However, the PSL has stood firm and taken its dispute with Zifa to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and has declared that it would not relegate any club until a determination has been made by the Swiss-based sports court.
