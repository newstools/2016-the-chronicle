Mehluli Sibanda in Moruleng, South Africa FORMER Zimbabwe international Elasto Kapowezha says the mediocre performance of the Young Warriors at the Cosafa Under-20 Youth Championship in North West, South Africa, shows the country is not building for the future. Kapowezha (42) said he had expected a lot from the Zimbabwean lads, considering the country s history in the Cosafa Under-20, which they have won six times. As a Zimbabwean I was hugely disappointed with our boys at this level looking at our record in this tournament. We normally get to the final together with Zambia. Although Zambia has been dominant, we have come close. To be knocked out in the first round and to concede five goals against Zambia shows there wasn t much we offered in this tournament. It s a tournament we should take seriously, as it is the future, said Kapowezha.Kapowezha, who represented the country at both junior and senior levels and was known as Elasto Lungu, said while there had been some individual brilliance in the past, it was hard to single out any player in this tournament.Only captain and goalkeeper Nelson Chadya came close to brilliance and has the potential to be the Warriors goalminder.He said there must be a change in approach taking into account the lads performances in two matches. You would expect us to have a strong development structure that can produce players for our senior national team, but this tournament tells us that we are way behind and something needs to be done, Kapowezha said.The Young Warriors were bundled out of the tournament after finishing bottom of their three-team group with one point.Zimbabwe were humiliated 1-5 by Zambia in their opening game and registered a goalless draw against Malawi.Meanwhile, the Cosafa elective annual general meeting is taking place at Sun City in Rustenburg on Saturday, with election results expected to be announced at midday.@Mdawini_29
