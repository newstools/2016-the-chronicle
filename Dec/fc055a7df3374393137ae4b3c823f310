Luke MasomereAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter FORMER Border Strikers coach Luke Masomere says he has no intentions of coaching in the First Division following the expiry of his contract with the Division One-bound Beitbridge-based outfit. The nomadic former Masvingo United, Shabanie Mine and How Mine gaffer said he would seriously need to consider a lot of things before making a decision about his coaching career. My contract with Border Strikers ended on the last day of November, so right now I m not employed. There are a lot of things I will need to consider before making any decision as far as coaching in the lower divisions is concerned. The thing is I have never given a thought about coaching in any lower division, whether locally or in South Africa, said Masomere.Border Strikers were relegated from the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League with three rounds of matches to play, with Masomere failing to register a single victory in the few games that he was in charge.They finished the season at the bottom of the log after losing 23 times, drawing thrice and winning four times. One of their victories was against former champions Dynamos at Dulivhadzimu Stadium.Masomere joined Border Strikers from a football time-out after having parted ways with How Mine in 2015.However, he failed in his attempted mission to save the league debutants from the chop.Masomere was confident of landing a job with a Premiership side for the 2017 season. Right now I am resting at home, but definitely I will be employed soon; that one I can assure you. At Border Strikers it was worth it and I learnt one or two things there. It was nice working with the guys from the players to the management. The team is from a small town and I learnt that unity is everything in soccer. In football you cannot prosper as long as you are divided and tribalised, Masomere said without elaborating.@khumzallen
