Bongani Ndlovu, Sports Correspondent UNCERTAINTY hangs over the beginning of Zimbabwe s premier first class cricket, the Logan Cup, scheduled for tomorrow, with Zimbabwe Cricket remaining mum. Two Logan Cup matches between Bulawayo Metropolitan Tuskers and Rhinos set for Queens Sports Club as well as Mountaineers and Harare Metropolitan Eagles were cancelled last week.Sources said the matches could not get underway because ZC had not disbursed money for travelling and accommodation costs for the franchises.ZC temporarily set tomorrow as the start of the games, but sources yesterday maintained that no money had been sent to franchises and no formal communication had been sent by ZC informing them about the new dates. We don t know whether games will be played this Thursday. We re all in the dark, but contracts and allowances have been paid. ZC is responsible for all allowances; we just send the budget and they send the money, said the source.ZC spokesperson Darlington Majonga said he was in a meeting and would call Chronicle Sport later and his phone rang unanswered hours later.
