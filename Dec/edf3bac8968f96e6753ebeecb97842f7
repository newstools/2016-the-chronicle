Rahman Gumbo Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Chicken Inn Coach Rahman Gumbo has reacted angrily to reports that he applied for the vacant Triangle United coaching post. The Lowveld side parted ways with their head coach David Mandigora who apparently failed to meet his contractual target which according to sources was a top four finish. “I never applied for the Triangle United post nor seek employment at any other team for that matter. I am a professional coach who believes in loyalty.  It is them (Triangle United) who wrote to me but I never responded. I am happy at Chicken Inn and I want to build a strong team for next year,” said Gumbo. This publication is in possession of two letters from Triangle United, the first one  offering Gumbo the post with the club asking him to state his salary and other conditions of service. The letter was originated by club secretary Abraham Chinemaringa. The second letter was asking Gumbo why he had not responded to their offer. The ambitions of Triangle United might scare away top coaches who might not want to tarnish their image as the club has now parted ways with three coaches in two years. First they demoted Biggie Zuze to an assistant coach under Kelvin Kaindu before the Zambian packed his bags for How Mine. He was then replaced by Mandigora this season. “I really don’t want to confuse people, my players and indeed my employers, I don’t behave like that,” said Gumbo who has had stints in Malawi and Botswana where he led the clubs to league titles outside the local gong with Bulawayo giants Amahlolanyama which was his first as a coach. The former Warriors midfielder and coach signed a two year contract with the GameCocks this year where he outlined his plans for Chicken Inn. “I want to do more than what I did before when I was in the local league.Chicken Inn qualified to play in the Champions League and I have been there before. I want to go a step higher with Chicken Inn,” said Gumbo.
