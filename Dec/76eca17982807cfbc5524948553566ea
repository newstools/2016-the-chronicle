 Cynthia Dube, Court Reporter A NATIONAL University of Science and Technology (NUST) student was yesterday ordered to pay $60 a month towards the upkeep of his two children. Leo Maposa who is on attachment, was dragged to court by his ex-girlfriend Ms Nomvelo Halimana who was demanding $300 maintenance a month. Ms Halima said Maposa was a drunkard who was not taking care of his children. Maphosa said he could not afford to pay maintenance because he was not being paid where he was on attachment. “Your worship, I am a student and l don`t get paid where l` m attached. I`m still depending on my parents who are paying for my education,” said Maposa. Bulawayo Magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya said poverty was not an excuse for neglecting one’s children. “You cannot come to court and plead poverty. Instead of making an offer you are busy telling the court that you don`t have money. That was the first thing that you were supposed to think before ‘making’ these children,” he said. Mr Tashaya ordered Maposa to pay $60 maintenance starting this month. @cyntyhiamthyembo1
