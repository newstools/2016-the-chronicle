Lovemore Zigara, Midlands Correspondent NINETY-eight small-scale dairy farmers have benefited from the Dairy Revitalisation Programme (DRP) scheme, which facilitated the importation of 400 dairy cows into the country. The Zimbabwe Association of Dairy Farmers (ZADF) and the Zimbabwe Dairy Industrial Trust (ZDIT) are coordinating the programme.The scheme meant to boost the national dairy herd, is funded from the 25 percent levy on imported dairy products imposed by the Government.ZADF president Mr Emmanuel Zimbandu told Business Chronicle the association will next month assess the impact of the scheme with a view to establish which areas still need cows.The objective is to ensure the country produces adequate milk for its consumption. I am happy to announce that we received the full consignment of dairy cows, which we have since given to small-scale dairy farmers across the country, he said.The programme is expected to go a long way in mitigating milk shortages in the country. It is estimated that the dairy sector is operating at about 45 percent capacity, with an estimated 223 registered dairy operators and a total dairy herd of about 26 000 battling to meet demand.The country is producing about five million litres of milk per month against a monthly demand of 10 million litres. The balance is being offset by imports.National milk production increased from 150 million litres in 1980, peaking at 256 million litres in 1990 before plummeting to an all-time low of 36 million litres in 2009.The country has a potential to process 400 million litres of milk per year.The Government has spared dairy farms from compulsory acquisition under the land reform programme as part of efforts to boost milk production.@lavuzigara1
