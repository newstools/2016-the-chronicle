The Mighty Warriors were shortlisted for Africa s best women soccer team in the Glo-Caf Awards alongside champions Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana and South Africa.The best national team will be crowned on January 5 in Nigeria at the Glo Caf Awards.Mlauzi said the nomination should motivate the girls to do better. We are happy with the recognition from Caf and Fifa because it has always been our aim to raise the national flag high. This keeps the players and the technical team working hard and aspiring to do better. It s not by luck that we are among the best five on the continent, but we have been playing good football, said Mlauzi.With the Mighty Warriors the only side not to qualify for the semi-finals at the Women s Afcon, Mlauzi said chances of them scooping the top award were non-existent. It s a very formidable line-up of nominees and we are greatly honoured to be competing against great players, whom we have huge respect for. To be nominated alongside them shows we are doing something right and it s a great achievement just to be nominated. I guess to be the best you need to compete against the best. The honour of being shortlisted means a lot to us, let alone having Khama Billiat also vying for the Best African Player award and the Under-17 soccer team being crowned champions shows that we have the talent, Mlauzi said.Cameroon were named the best women s soccer team in Africa in 2015.@khumzallen
