RONALDOWorld player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo rejected a world record 257million (300m euros, $317m) bid from China, his agent Jorge Mendes has claimed. Mendes told Sky Sports Italia on Thursday that the unnamed Chinese Super League side had offered the 31-year-old Portuguese superstar a record 85m a year as salary.&#8220;From China, they&#8217;ve offered 300m euros to Real Madrid and more than 100m (euros) per year to the player,&#8221; said Mendes.&#8220;But money is not everything. Real Madrid is his life. Cristiano is happy at Real Madrid and it is impossible to go to China.&#8221;China has through its Super League clubs flexed considerable financial muscle in the international transfer market, most recently buying Brazilian international Oscar from Chelsea and Argentinian veteran Carlos Tevez &#8212; with the latter reportedly set to earn 38 million euros a year.However, Mendes said the star of his stable was out of reach.&#8220;The Chinese market is a new market,&#8221; said Mendes.&#8220;They can buy a lot of players, but then again it is impossible to go for Ronaldo.&#8220;Cristiano is the best player in the world and best ever. It is normal to have some offers.&#8220;He won the European Championship with Portugal, it&#8217;s like winning the Italian league with Genoa: they were not the favourite,&#8221; added the 50-year-old Portuguese.
