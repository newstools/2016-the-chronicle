We decided to host this event in Bulawayo after realising the city didn t have much entertainment activities during the week. In order to captivate audiences, the dance groups will dance to two songs only. This is not a show, but a gathering of dance groups in Bulawayo to see which one is the best. Each group will have two songs to prove their worth, said Mapimhidze.The event is expected to start at 6PM.Meanwhile, Mapimhidze who doubles up as Bev s manager, said his artiste s show at Stop Over had been postponed from Friday and would be held in October.
