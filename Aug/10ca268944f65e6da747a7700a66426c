Whinsley Masara Chronicle Reporter SOLDIERS have been urged to remain focused and not be swayed by elements attempting to oust the constitutionally elected Zanu-PF Government.The call was made yesterday by the Commander of 1 Infantry Brigade in Bulawayo, Brigadier General Augustine Chipwere at a ceremony at which the brigade and unit were presented with their colours. He said all troops must appreciate that discipline and training are the principal points of professionalism in the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and must be maintained at all times. I urge you to remain focused and not to be diverted by others who think that they can remove the Government unconstitutionally. Our core business is to ensure that the constitution remains upheld, said Brig Gen Chipwere. Our responsibility is to ensure that there is peace and tranquility at all times in the country. Yes here and there, there might be others who may think that they may divert us from that focus. We should remain focused in ensuring that peace and tranquility prevails and it is our constitutional obligation to make sure that we uphold peace at all times. Our Harare Bureau yesterday reported that the Government had taken to task South Africa s Gupta family-owned news channel Africa News Network 7 (ANN7) for carrying falsehoods that Zimbabwe s security forces had joined the opposition-led demonstrations.Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Permanent Secretary and Presidential spokesperson Mr George Charamba wrote to ANN7 after the television station broadcast a story originally published by CAJ News quoting unnamed security personnel claiming that they were joining the protests because they had not been paid.According to a Zimbabwe Defence Forces official, the soldiers were actually paid on August 22. @winnie_masara
