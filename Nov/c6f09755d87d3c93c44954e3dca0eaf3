Nqobile Tshili DONATED blankets meant for three hospitals in Bulawayo and Gwanda are stuck at the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority warehouse in Beitbridge due to alleged red tape. The president of the South Africa-Zimbabwe Business Connect, Mr Justice Maphosa, said last August he sourced blankets for Mpilo Central Hospital, the United Bulawayo Hospitals and Gwanda District Hospital, but they were still stuck in a Zimra warehouse in Beitbridge due to alleged red tape.Mr Maphosa said he sourced 1 000 blankets and an electric wheel chair for a Harare man, but he was now being forced to pay storage fees for the goods. It s a bonded warehouse, and it s expensive to keep them there. The expense does not bother me because we ship in stuff and it gets held there. But what really makes me sad is that it s a donation for hospitals. It s a donation for three hospitals Mpilo, United Bulawayo Hospitals and Gwanda hospital. Gwanda got 200 blankets, UBH 400 blankets and Mpilo 400, said Mr Maphosa.He said he was going through a cumbersome process to get the goods cleared.Mr Maphosa said red tape was stifling development in the country. They take you from pillar to post. Today they need this document tomorrow they need that document. They seem to be less interest in getting them cleared. They re looking for this document and that document. You ll never know what exactly they need. There is always a new document that they need, said Mr Maphosa. We can t treat a donation like that, we can t treat investment wrongly. It s a door that knocks once and it s gone. If I was someone who is short tempered and short sighted I would have withdrawn those blankets and sold them back in South Africa and gotten my money back. He said delays in clearing the blankets were frustrating the other developmental projects they have in the country.Zimra s spokesperson Mr Canisio Mudzimu requested that questions be put in writing but had not responded by the time of going to print.@nqotshili
