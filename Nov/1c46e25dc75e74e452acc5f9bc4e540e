Sandile LupuwanaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter MATABELELAND Warriors duo of prop Irvine Nduwa and hooker Sandile Lupuwana are part of the 26 Sables players that will represent the country at the Cup of Nations Rugby Tournament set for Hong Kong next week. The national rugby team is expected to leave the country next week for the end of year competition to be played from November 11-19.Nduwa (23) and Lupuwana (24) made it into the Sables squad after impressing coach Cyprian Mangenge during the national team camp that started last week in Harare.The duo also impressed at last month s national team trials held at Hartsfield Ground where they featured for the Southern Select side, which beat Northern Select 15-12.Southern Select manager Simba Dangah said the national team door is still open for more Matabeleland-based players. To have two of our guys making it into the national squad, which has 15 international players and 11 locally-based guys is good for our game. We hope to have more guys from the Southern Region making it into national teams because the guys from the Sables have told us the doors are still open for our players and all they need to do is keep working hard, said Dangah.The Sables, who lost all their fixtures at last year s Cup of Nations Rugby Tournament to Hong Kong, Portugal and Russia, will be hoping that international players such as South African-based flanker Biselele Tshamala, the France-based duo of prop Farai Mudariki and Michael Passiportis inspire the side to strong performances.
