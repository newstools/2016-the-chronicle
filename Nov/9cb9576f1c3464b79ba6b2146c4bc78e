The ticket issued to Akbay by the police for beating a robot Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter A cop based at Bulawayo Central Police Station faces disciplinary action for allegedly taking a picture of a ticket issued to Highlanders’ Dutch coach Erol Akbay recently for a traffic offence. The picture of the ticket, which has gone viral on social media platforms, appears to have been taken before it was plucked out of the main ticket book, raising the ire of provincial police commanders. According to details on the ticket, Akbay, also a qualified driving instructor, went through a red robot along Leopold Takawira Avenue and was stopped by one Constable Rwodzi (force number shown) stationed at Bulawayo Central Police Station. “This is an unacceptable behaviour from the police officer. These are the very people who release sensitive security matters to the public, issues which would have been discussed internally and this calls for serious action,” said a senior police officer. Akbay confirmed being ticketed for a traffic offence last week. “Although I never went through a red robot, the police officer still issued me with the $20 ticket and I wonder why he took a picture of it; probably to show it to other guys or even the media that he arrested a Highlanders coach, but I am not giving that much thought. I never asked him why he was taking pictures of the ticket,” said Akbay.
