Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Under-20 technical bench has dropped five players from the on-going Cosafa Under-20 Championships camp in Harare while two were left out following a club versus country feud and a request for another national assignment respectively. South Africa based Patrick Musaka, who plies his trade for Black Leopards was denied clearance by the South African side who said the Cosafa Under-20 Championships were not on the Fifa calendar and therefore they were not compelled to release him. Bantu Rovers Denzel Khumalo could also not make it following a request by the Zimbabwe coach for the African Union Sports Council Region Five Under-20 Games football team. The Angola bound guys feel the boy will be instrumental in their squad and they made a request that they use him and we agreed, said the Young Warriors gaffer Mandla Lulu Mpofu.Of the five players dropped, Yadah FC s Leeroy Mavunga never reported for camp and the coaches had no option but to leave him out. On Sunday we released Kuzivakwashe Madina from Catholic Saints, Raynold Mate from FC Platinum, Frederick Muza from Mutare City and Brighton Mhungu from Friendly Academy, said Mpofu.The former Railstars, Chicken Inn and Bantu Rovers gaffer said morale in camp was high and the boys were showing hunger for success.
