Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter MATABELELAND Rugby Football Board (MRFB) s select side s tour to Zambia hangs in the balance, with the board yet to secure funding and clearance from the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) for the trip. The squad is scheduled to play three matches against three unnamed Zambian clubs either in Lusaka or Livingstone on November 26.Simba Dangah, the MRFB select side manager, said they are working on clearance issues, while the squad made up of players picked during last month s senior national team s trials has been training at Hartsfield Grounds. We remain hopeful of going for the trip and we re working on getting clearance and other logistics. Remember the purpose of this tour is to give these guys exposure and the board wants the guys to end the year with a tour as a way of motivating players and creating excitement ahead of the start of next season, Dangah said.MRFB secretary-general Craig Change said they are making frantic efforts to secure funding for both the team and a tournament that they intend staging at Hartsfield before the end of the year. Everything boils down to the money factor and as a board we really want to see our players exposed to competitive opponents, which will in turn enhance their chances of competing for places in the national team. Going to Zambia will give players the exposure we re talking about because our desire is to see more players from the southern region getting into national teams. We ll appreciate help from individuals and the corporate world, as our endeavour is to develop the game in the region and expose our talent to competition, said Change.Some players that make up the MRFB select team include seasoned winger Gardner Nechironga, who came out of retirement last year, scrumhalf Lloyd Machanjaire, right centre Japhet Ndebele, who has represented Zimbabwe at different competitions, and eighth man Jason Mackay.Tighthead prop Victor Chiwara, locks Kudakwashe Nyakufaringwa and Velile Dube, left-flanker and vice-captain Michael Zvakavapano as well as fullback Andrea Banda.The team has been training under the close supervision of Cheetahs coach Gilbert Nyamutsamba, Reuben Kumpasa and Ziffy Dzinomurumbi @ZililoR.
