Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Amateur Football Association (Bafa) has suspended three players from taking part in the league after they were found guilty of misconduct. Rebel s Brendon Mpala was slapped with a two- year ban while SBC Falcons Sikhumbuzo Moyo and Mpilo United s Terence Nyarambi were each banned for one year.Mpala was found guilty of bringing the game of football into disrepute when he assaulted an SBC Falcons player in their league encounter last month.Moyo, who was spotted playing for Safeguard, was found guilty of playing for two clubs without a clearance letter while Nyarambi was also found guilty of the same charge when he was seen playing for Rebels.All the three players are therefore not allowed to participate in any Bafa activities until they serve their suspensions.Meanwhile, Rebels was also docked three points and fined $50 for fielding an ineligible player in their league match against Sporting Vipers.The clubs/players have up to Wednesday to appeal against Bafa decisions. Bafa is an affiliation of Zifa so we will try as much as possible to make this league professional by strictly abiding by the rules of football and the association s, said Bafa disciplinary board member Oscar Mazhambe.He said when a team wins the Bafa championship, they get an automatic ticket to Division Three. We therefore won t take any issues of misconduct lightly, said Mazhambe. &#8211; @khumzallen
