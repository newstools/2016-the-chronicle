 Melissa Mpofu, Showbiz Editor PATIENTS at Mpilo Central Hospital will be spoilt tomorrow when Delta Beverages – organisers of the Biggest Braai Festival – donates six tonnes of meat to them. Last month, Delta through its Castle brand, made a commitment to donate an equivalent amount of meat eaten at the festival in Harare to Mpilo and Harare Hospitals as part of their corporate social responsibility. A total of 12 463kgs of beef, chicken and pork were eaten at the successful braai which attracted about 5 000 people. A ceremony has been lined up by Mpilo hospital where the Minister of Health and Child Welfare, David Parirenyatwa, is expected to receive the 6 140kgs meat on behalf of the patients. Montana Meats and Colcom have once again been tasked to supply the meat, though mostly beef will be donated as it has a longer shelf life. Patricia Murambinda, Delta Beverages marketing manager said they were happy to be giving back to the community. “Delta Beverages is not all about manufacturing and selling drinks to make a profit. We’re also about giving back to the very same community that has supported us over the years,” said Murambinda. “Every glass of Castle that was raised at the braai in October went beyond the beer to help our brothers and sisters who are hospitalised. “People came out in their numbers to support this worthy cause and we’re glad to be donating the meat to Mpilo for patients to also experience what others experienced at the braai.”
