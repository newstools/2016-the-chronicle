ZIMBABWE are hosting Sri Lanka and West Indies in the exciting Tri-nation Series 2016. Sri Lanka, who are in Zimbabwe after their victorious Test series, were joined by West Indies for some further contest of cricket as the three teams engage in a tournament that involves seven One-Day Internationals (ODIs).Each of the teams get to play two matches with the other two teams to accumulate more points to go up in the points table and qualify for the final. West Indies have had a disastrous UAE tour recently as they lost all their matches to Pakistan in the limited-overs format, while Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe have not had a very good time as well.West Indies time in the UAE against Pakistan was nothing short of a nightmare.The team, who are the reigning world champions in the Twenty20 International (T20I) format, failed to perform in both 20 overs and 50 overs games.There was hardly any positive for them to take from the matches except from one or two heroics.Sri Lanka s last encounter in limited-overs was also an unsuccessful one with Australia at home.After a clinical performance with a 3-0 in Tests, they failed to maintain the similar run in ODIs and T20Is, losing both the series in turn.TableM W L T N/R P NRRWest Indies 1 1 0 0 0 5 1.24Sri Lanka 2 1 1 0 0 5 0.485Zimbabwe 1 0 1 0 0 0 -3.247For the hosts Zimbabwe, this series is very much important and a great chance to get back to winning terms.
