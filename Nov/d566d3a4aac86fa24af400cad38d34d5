Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter LEGENDARY former Highlanders player and manager Lawrence Phiri has called on all former players to meet at the club house this Wednesday to discuss how they can assist the club organise its 90th celebrations. Highlanders turns 90 this year and Phiri feels as yesteryear players there is need to be part of this historic moment. I know that the club will be having its end of year awards on December 2 and as people who played for this great club and even managed it, I think we need to also have a table on this day just to render morale and even financial support to the system. Our little contribution will go a long way. I am therefore calling upon all those former greats to come to the club house this Wednesday so that we put our heads together, said Phiri.To kick start the process Phiri held a brief meeting on Saturday at the club house with greats like Mark Watson, Billy Sibanda and Barry Daka. Our meeting today was just to apprise each other on this project. We understand a table on the awards night will have 10 people but we are many so we just want to come up with a position on how we will do this, said the legend.Phiri said he was still trying to get hold of Bruce Grobbelaar and Boet Van-As. We always take pride to be associated with this club, to me Highlanders has never been just a football team, its an institution and our way of life, said Phiri who still vividly remembers the club s first major cup triumph in 1973 when they lifted the Chibuku Cup following a 3-0 win over Mhangura at Rufaro Stadium.Meanwhile, Phiri said Highlanders now need to transform their way of doing business in order to meet the demands of modern day football. Highlanders can no longer afford to survive just as a football team, they need to transform and run as a business entity, said Phiri.&nbsp;
