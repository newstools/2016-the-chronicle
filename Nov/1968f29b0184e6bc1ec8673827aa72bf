Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter A legislator has accused Zifa of violence against women for allegedly ill-treating the Mighty Warriors by giving them a paltry $5 each after their participation at the Rio Olympics in August. Contributing during a parliamentary debate last week on action to end violence against women and girls as part of this year s 16 Days of activism against gender based violence, Southerton MP Gift Chimanikire (MDC-T) said the treatment that the Mighty Warriors received from Zifa and even the nation as a whole was tantamount to violence against women. Even the way we are treating the Mighty Warriors, our own women footballers, that is violence against women. They go and play at Olympics. After playing football during the Olympics we give them $5 each, what is that Mr. Speaker? Zifa has also to be advised that it is violence against women. That has to stop, said Chimanikire.This year s 16 Days of Activism from November 25 up until December 10 runs under the theme From peace in the home to peace in the world make education accessible and affordable for girls and end violence against women and girls .Early this year, the Government promised to avail 30 residential stands to the Mighty Warriors for qualifying for the 10th African Women Nations Cup finals now underway in Cameroon. From our side as Government we have decided that in the absence of cash which is difficult given the constraints within our fiscal space, we are going to go kind. And I can announce now that we have put together here in Harare today 30 residential stands for the Mighty Warriors. And (Philip) Chiyangwa is going to take over from me. I have already told him the details he is aware of what is supposed to be done so that during the course of this week each one of you (Mighty Warriors team members) is shown their stand. That s the Government s appreciation of what the girls have done, Sport and Recreation Minister Makhosini Hlongwane was quoted in April.
