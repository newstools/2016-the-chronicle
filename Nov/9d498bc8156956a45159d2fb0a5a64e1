Richard Muponde, Gwanda Correspondent POLICE have launched a manhunt for suspects in the case of a slain ringleader of a gang of gold panners who died on Monday night during bloody clashes with a rival group in Filabusi. Police said they were appealing to people with information that may assist them to apprehend those who fatally attacked Qalisani Moyo, a nephew to Esigodini gold baron Mr Baron Dube, to come forward.Moyo was axed to death after his right foot was chopped off in a fight over a gold claim at HeyHill Farm.Matabeleland South police spokesperson Inspector Philisani Ndebele yesterday said they were still looking for the assailants. No arrests have been made at the moment. Investigations are still going on and we are appealing to anyone who might have information on the whereabouts of the murder suspects to come forward and inform the police or report to their nearest police station, he said.Moyo, who was believed to be the ring leader of a group of gold panners, was killed after he was allegedly assigned by Mr Dube to wrest control of a gold claim from rivals.Mr Dube said he owns the disputed gold claim.When Moyo and his group arrived at the claim, bloody clashes erupted leading to Moyo s fatal axing.Several people including members from both Moyo s gang and the rival group sustained serious injuries.In an interview on Wednesday, Mr Dube said his nephew died for nothing as Moyo and 14 others went to the gold claim, not to fight, but for talks with a rival group at the instigation of the police.He said on the day his relative died, they were supposed to travel together to the claim, but he later decided against going there.Mr Dube said he never incited violence but some people (names supplied) who were once his security guards at the claim mobilised over 400 gold panners against him.The gold baron said on Sunday he nearly died as the mob of gold panners armed with machetes and axes cornered him, but they retreated after he drew his pistol.However, police insist Mr Dube mobilised gold panners and went to the gold claim and attacked the other group which was mining there.-@richardmuponde.
