Gift MbwetiSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO giants Highlanders have made overtures for the Hwange striking duo of Newman Sianchali and pint-sized Gift Mbweti as they begin preparations for the 2017 season. Sianchali was recently released by Hwange after requesting for a contract termination last month when the coal miners failed to fulfil agreed contractual obligations and he is believed to be training with Bulawayo City.The previously unheralded Mbweti was a revelation for Hwange and remains in contention to land the Castle Lager Premiership Golden Boot accolade. He is presently two goals shy of veteran Caps United striker Leonard Tsipa heading into the last two rounds of matches of the 2016 season. Mbweti, who is almost certain to be among the Castle Lager Soccer Stars of the Year, has scored nine goals.Sources told Chronicle Sport yesterday that members of the Highlanders Hwange Supporters Chapter were handling the negotiations and Bosso chief executive officer Ndumiso Gumede had also spoken to Sianchali. He asked the player to table his demands for the club to look at. I think from the way things are going, Sianchali could be playing for Highlanders next season and chances are also high that Mbweti will join him at Bosso, said a source. Mbweti s contract with the coalminers runs out at the end of next season.Highlanders have been struggling for goals since the departure of Bruce Kangwa for Azam in Tanzania, but the left-footed player was also not a natural striker.Despite leaving for Tanzania sometime back, Kangwa is still the club s leading scorer with seven goals followed by Prince Dube and resurgent midfielder Simon Munawa on five goals each.Highlanders have been relying on Nhlanhla Ndlovu, speedster Gabriel Nyoni and veteran striker Ralph Matema, who is, however, injury prone and cannot be relied on next season.Young Dube though has been heavily involved in most goals his teammates have netted. Highlanders coach Erol Akbay recently confirmed that he was in the hunt for seasoned strikers to complement his young and inexperienced strike force. @skhumoyo2000
