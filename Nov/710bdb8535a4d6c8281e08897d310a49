He is not acting CEO but we met as executive and board and decided that their roles are similar, Ngwenya said.Ndlovu said he will hold fort while the club s legal team attends to Gumede and Dube s bans. I will be assuming the role of CEO as our team handles the ban. I m still the secretary general and not acting CEO, said Ndlovu. @ZililoR
