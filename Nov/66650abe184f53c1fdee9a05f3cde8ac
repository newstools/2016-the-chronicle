Kudakwashe MahachiFungai Muderere, Sports Reporter WARRIORS midfield dynamo Kudakwashe Mahachi says he is happy to return to the senior national team set up following his recent recovery from an arm injury. The Mzilikazi-bred star, who now endures playing with a metal pin in his right arm after suffering a fracture in August during a Warriors training session in preparation for the away match against Guinea, is among the foreign-based players called up for the friendly against Tanzania on Sunday in Harare.Mahachi came worse off an aerial tussle with Maritzburg United defender Blessing Moyo, the former Chicken Inn, ace landing awkwardly on his wrist during a training session at Gateway High School. I m happy the national team coaches have shown confidence in me. The injury was a temporary setback. I have been fighting for my starting place at my club (Golden Arrows) and I will also fight for it in the national team, said Mahachi soon after joining the Warriors camp. I will have to take it easy and work hard at training. Scoring goals is not my top priority now. I m focusing on regaining my form and to do well for my club and country in the next assignments.
