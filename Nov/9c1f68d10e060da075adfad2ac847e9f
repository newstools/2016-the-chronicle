Munyaradzi Musiiwa, Midlands Correspondent THE Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education has launched a probe after female teachers at a school in Mberengwa accused their headmaster of sexually abusing them using mubobobo. Villagers from surrounding communities and female teachers approached provincial education authorities saying they were no longer comfortable working with Chegato Primary School headmaster identified only as Mr Zhou. Midlands Provincial Education Director Mrs Agnes Gudo said they were carrying out investigations. We are still investigating the matter and we hope to conclude it soon. There have been allegations of witchcraft but we are waiting for a traditional leader in the area to give us a full report from the community. Procedurally and as a matter of policy if teachers and local communities are no longer comfortable to work with a teacher or headmaster we usually transfer him or her, she said. Chief Mposi said they were in the process of getting the opinion of the community as well as the School Development Committee before submitting a report to the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education as required.There was drama at the school last week when aggrieved parents and female teachers who had allegedly fallen prey to the headmaster s mubobobo escapades engaged an inyanga to conduct a cleansing ceremony.Five female teachers at the school claimed that the headmaster had sex with them using muti which enabled him to abuse them even though there was no physical contact. The female teachers approached a traditional leader who helped them hire an inyanga to conduct the cleansing, said a teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity.The teacher said during the cleansing ceremony, the inyanga alleged that Mr Zhou was using mubobobo on female teachers and possesses a goblin.
