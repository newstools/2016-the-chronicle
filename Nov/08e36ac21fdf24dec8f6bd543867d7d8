Richard Muponde,Gwanda Correspondent JAPAN has shown a keen interest in investing in gold and Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the town of Gwanda. Speaking at a meeting in Gwanda last week, the head of a high powered Japanese delegation which paid a courtesy call on the mining town to explore investment opportunities, Mr Minae Takahashi, said the mining town was a good area to operate in. We have keen interest in mining and ICT because we are well versed in such businesses. Currently we are working with 20 various towns including Mutare, Harare, Bulawayo and Masvingo, said Mr Takahashi, who is also a consultant for Grassroots Grant Project.He said his company has vast experience from the past concerning communities that have grown to big cities because of ICT. We have a living example of a town in Japan which brought the birth of computer giant Panasonic. It s our dream too to turn Gwanda to a similar growth with this town in Japan, said Mr Takahashi.Gwanda Mayor Councillor Knowledge Ndlovu told the delegation that Gwanda lies on a massive gold belt and the two should map a way on how they would partner in several business investments available. As council we are more than happy to welcome visitors that will bring growth to our small mining town. We are endowed with a lot of natural resources with gold topping the list. However, as council we will look for viable projects and direct them to our Japanese friends to explore, said Clr Ndlovu.He said the council would come up with a strong project proposal so that the Japanese Embassy can come in handy, especially in development of infrastructure in schools and hospitals.Clr Ndlovu also implored the Japanese delegation to consider ICT as a viable project in the town. Unlike other big towns and cities, Gwanda town is lagging behind in ICT hence the need to take that route. @richardmuponde
