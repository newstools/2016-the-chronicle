Cynthia Dube, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo s Njube suburb yesterday disowned his wife of 18 years in court, saying he was already married to another woman. Ms Sinikiwe Sibanda (54) was seeking $176 spousal maintenance from Julius Ncube (42).She told Bulawayo Magistrate Ms Sithembiso Ncube that she was customarily married to Ncube in 1998.Ncube interjected saying he had a relationship with her outside marriage. Your Worship, I m not married to this woman. I m legally married under Chapter 37 (5.11) and my wife also attended this court. I cannot deny the fact that I was in a relationship with this woman for the past 18 years. I cannot be married to someone who is 12 years older than me. I was even surprised to receive summons from this woman claiming more than $100 from me, said Ncube.He said he dumped Ms Sibanda in April this year.In response, Ms Sibanda said she was aware that her husband was now married to their neighbour.She said her sister Mrs Elitha Masuku had attended the court session to collaborate her story.Mrs Masuku confirmed that Ms Sibanda and Ncube were customarily married. Ncube came to our parents and paid introduction fees seven years ago. I m surprised that Ncube is now denying his wife in front of all these people. The painful part is that he is dumping my younger sister because he married their neighbour, said Mrs Masuku.The magistrate said there was no evidence that Ncube and Ms Sibanda were married. May you please come back to court on December 5. Bring witnesses who were there when Ncube came to pay introduction fees to your family. You can even bring the paper where an agreement was written when Ncube was paying the money to your family, said Ms Ncube.@cynthiamthembo1
