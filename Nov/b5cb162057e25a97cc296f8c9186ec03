THE 2016 edition of the Hwange Open golf tournament is on this weekend at the Hwange Golf Club. Hwange captain Artwell Ndebele said a maximum field of 120 amateur golfers was expected to take part in the tournament, which will not feature professionals. This year we are not having professionals. We expect to have a maximum playing field. Temperatures have been high lately, but lots of work has been done on the greens and it is still ongoing as we strive to ensure golfers enjoy the game, said Ndebele. I am also assuring everyone that contingency plans have been put in place to ensure adequate watering holes on the course for the duration given the immense heat, besides also having on site a fully equipped medical tent at hole number 10 to deal with any emergencies, he said.He also highlighted that the engagement with stakeholders on sponsorship was highly encouraging and this would complement fundraising initiatives currently underway. The engagement with old and new corporate stakeholders is pleasing despite the prevailing economic challenges in the country and their input will ably complement what we get from fundraising initiatives which are in full swing. The sacrifice from sponsors is huge hence we will acknowledge them individually to accord them some mileage for their gestures. From the Championship Division, a lot will be expected from Chiredzi golfer Visitors Chapwanya, although lots of competition will come from the likes of Gweru Golf Club golfers Liberty Gumusa and Martin Masvimbo, Mayfred Sibanda (Bulawayo), Josphat Phiri (Elephant Hills) and Zambian Jefferson Phiri.Same division local golfers like Vumbu Ncube, Christian Lungu and Michael Phiri will hope to use the course knowledge to their full advantage.The A Division will have Edwin Moyo, Didymus Ngorora, Victor Rakabopa and Amos Lungu, among others.The B Division will see Thomas Makore and Bongani Ndlovu, the Hwange Golf Club president and chairman respectively taking to the greens alongside Vumi Moyo, Zvitongeyi Chihowa, Eric Moyo and Ntungamili Matshanga.2015 Ladies Gold Division champion Acy Zerf is expected to defend her title, but should be wary of Stella Feldsman, Terry Tshamala, Mehluko Sibanda, Viola Musengi and Matron Mguni, while the Bronze Division will be a battle between Shelly Gwanonga, Prisca Chimukoko, Virginia Mabhena and Colleen Rakabopa.The 2015 Hwange Open was won by professional golfer and former TV personality Gary Thompson, while Robson Chinhoyi clinched the amateurs championship division.@tobymandox.
