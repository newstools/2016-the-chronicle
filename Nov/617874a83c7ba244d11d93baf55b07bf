Your Worship, Valary was teaching me Maths and English but we ended up falling in love and l got pregnant. My parents got frustrated and ordered me to go and stay with him, she said. He told me that he got a job and was moving from Bulawayo to stay in Harare. I went back to stay with my family. Ever since l was pregnant he never bought anything for our child. Gotoza said he can afford to pay $50 monthly for the upkeep of his child but Bulawayo Magistrate Mr Batanai Tuwe told him that $50 was too little. Sir, you took advantage of a pupil, spoiled her future and you re now offering only $50. Your payslip shows me that you are earning $450 per month. You never contributed even a bond coin for your baby and you have the guts to offer only $50, said the magistrate.Gotoza said he has a lot of responsibilities and his wife is expecting a baby anytime from now.The magistrate ordered him to pay $100 every month for the upkeep of his child.@cynthiamthembo1.
