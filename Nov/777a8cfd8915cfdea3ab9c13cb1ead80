Cape Town &#8211; Following their 27-13 defeat in Cardiff, the Springboks have dropped one position below Wales to sixth in the latest official World Rugby rankings. It was only the third time that Wales had beaten South Africa and the victory was worth 0.78 of a rating point, taking them on to 82.55 points &#8211; just over two points behind fourth-placed Ireland.The loss means the Springboks have equalled their lowest ever position since the rankings began in October 2003.Elsewhere, Ireland boosted their tally by more than a point following their 27-24 win against Australia in Dublin. They are now just over two points behind the Wallabies and have every chance of catching them, if they enjoy a successful Six Nations, before the Rugby World Cup 2019 pool draw takes place on May 10, 2017.New Zealand and England, the top two sides in the rankings, didn t improve their points total as expected victories over France and Argentina came with no reward due to the difference in rating points between the nations.Scotland s 43-16 win over Georgia at Rugby Park, the home of Kilmarnock Football Club, earned them one-tenth of a rating point, which takes them to 80.67 points &#8211; just over one behind the Boks, who are in danger of dropping to eighth if the sides in and around them in the rankings have good Six Nations campaigns.
