Lewis UririSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Premier Soccer League have threatened to drag Zifa to the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) if the national association continues to insist on four teams being relegated. In a 28-page document addressed to Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa, the PSL questions the wisdom of changing the relegation format with just two games to go. A September 2015 Zifa Assembly agreed to relegate two teams and promote the same number after play-offs involving winners of the four Zifa regional Division One leagues.However, Zifa councillors voted to dump the 2015 resolution and instead relegate four sides from the PSL and promote four in a chaotic meeting last month.The document, authored by top Harare lawyer Lewis Uriri, who is also the Caps United chairman, wants promotion or relegation put on hold this year if Zifa insists on four teams going. The PSL is content with play-offs that will see two teams coming in and the same number relegated so the strongly worded letter wants to make it clear that it will not accept anything else, but if Zifa wants four teams relegated then that will be for next year not this year. If Zifa plays bully, then the matter will be taken to the highest sports court, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Zurich, Switzerland, said a source.With almost all the four regional First Division leagues about to end, Zifa is yet to come up with a clear position.In 2002, Zifa meddled in the affairs of Zimbabwe Saints, who were subsequently relegated, but Chikwata refused to play in Division One and instead took their matter CAS, which ruled that the club must remain in the Premiership.
