Conor McGregorIRISHMAN Conor McGregor made history by becoming the first fighter to hold two UFC belts simultaneously with a second-round knockout of Eddie Alvarez at New York s Madison Square Garden. The 28-year-old challenger, who went into the fight as the reigning featherweight champion, added the lightweight title when referee John McCarthy stopped the bout with just under two minutes of the second round remaining.McGregor dominated from the off and had Alvarez on the floor of the Octagon three times in the opening round, with the American wriggling free on both occasions.The Irishman, with a five-inch reach advantage over his opponent, began showboating in the second, holding his hands behind his back as Alvarez (32) looked to respond.It was one-way traffic and the bout was stopped when three consecutive punches knocked Alvarez to the floor and with McGregor ready to pounce, McCarthy dived in.In an expletive-ridden post-fight interview, McGregor said: Not one bit was surprising, they are not at my level. They have got to have size, reach, length, you have got to have some attributes. If you come in any way equal to me I am going to rip your head off, it happens every time. Eddie is a solid competitor, Eddie is a warrior, but he shouldn t have been in here with me and that s just the truth of it. It has never been done before. Everything I have dreamed is a reality. I have spent a lot time of time slating everyone in the company. I have ridiculed the entire roster and I just want to say from the bottom, I want to take this opportunity to apologise&#8230;to absolutely nobody! The Telegraph&nbsp;
