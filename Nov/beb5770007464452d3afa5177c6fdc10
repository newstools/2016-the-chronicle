We ve not received any information from the Government regarding bonuses. We re hoping that something positive will come up as promised. The traditional month for the payment of bonuses is November and we ve been hoping that the situation would normalise soon. The Government should find a permanent solution to these challenges so that its workers are motivated to serve their country, said Mr Ndlovu.Minister Mupfumira last week said payments for the December salaries would be announced in due course, taking into account revenue inflows. She is on record saying the Government is operating on a shoe-string budget, which is making it difficult to pay its workers.President Mugabe assured the civil servants that despite the low revenue inflows, the Government would still pay its workers the 13th cheque as per tradition.
