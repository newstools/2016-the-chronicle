Bloemfontein A young teacher at Bloemfontein s Grey College whose intimate kiss with a school prefect came to light in a WhatsApp message, has quit. The woman resigned after the incident was reported to school authorities. She will stay on at the school until the end of the year.She had apparently told several friends about the kiss in a message early this year, Netwerk24 reported.A spat between a number of teachers several months later reportedly led to the message being printed out and being brought to the attention of school authorities, who then started an investigation.The matric pupil, described as a brilliant student and good athlete, made a confidential settlement agreement to resign as prefect, which he has done.The school apparently now considers the matter closed.Someone close to the teacher told Netwerk24 that she d decided to leave Grey for other reasons long before the kiss incident came to light.She apparently is going to teach at another school. She is going to broaden her horizons, Netwerk24 was told.Grey principal Deon Scheepers confirmed the teacher s resignation. Sapa
