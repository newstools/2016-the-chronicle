The president of Talen Vision (Khumbulani Nkomo) has done a good job to sponsor this competition. The clubs which will participate stand to benefit a lot as this tournament will showcase local talent to the outside world since we re bringing four coaches from the Czech Republic to scout for talent. I invited them after my first visit to Zimbabwe and told them there is abundant talent in the country, said Kanku.Log leaders Bulawayo Chiefs, Bantu Rovers, Amagagasi, ZPC Hwange, ZRP Bulawayo and Talen Vision are guaranteed of participating in the end of season tournament.The four mid-table teams still hoping to win their respective matches on the last day of the season to cement slots in the tournament are seventh-placed Black Boots and Indlovu Iyanyathela, who are both tied on 37 points, Technosphere on 36 points and Victoria Falls Tigers (35).Bosso 90 stand in the way of Indlovu Iyanyathela, who they play host to at Luveve Stadium tomorrow, with Black Boots on the road to Turk Mine where they will face Casmyn, while Technosphere are home to Talen Vision in Hwange.Tigers take on Hwange Juniors in Victoria Falls on Sunday in a match that could be a dead rubber for Tigers should any of the three teams vying for the two slots win tomorrow.Kanku, who organised trial stints for the Talen Vision trio of Mbekezeli Sibanda, Njabulo Mpofu and Tawanda Muchaya at Slovakian topflight side FC Vion, will tomorrow watch Talen Vision s final league match of the season against Technosphere in Hwange @ZililoR.
