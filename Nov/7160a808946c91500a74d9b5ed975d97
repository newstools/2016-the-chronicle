Minister MushohweFreeman Razemba, Harare Bureau The Government does not condone witch-hunting practices that have become rampant countrywide and has not licensed anyone to conduct such activities, Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Christopher Mushohwe said yesterday. This comes after police yesterday also said they had noted with concern the rampant extortion on members of the public by self-styled prophets and tsikamutandas.In a statement, Dr Mushohwe said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday, such activities were declared criminal, fraudulent and extortionist. Cabinet noted with much regret and concern that a significant part of traditional leaders embracing chiefs, headmen and village heads are by commission or omission condoning this evil, primitive, extortionist and illegal practice that is condemned by our national laws, he said. Furthermore, the unscrupulous perpetrators and accomplices of witch-hunting have misrepresented to communities claiming that they had been permitted by the Government authorities to carry out the illegal activity, he said.Dr Mushohwe said the Government was calling upon anyone who might have fallen victim to the witch-hunters to report the matter to the law enforcement agencies so that the culprits could be brought to book and compensation paid. The Minister of Rural Development, Promotion and Preservation of Culture and Heritage, Honourable Abednico Ncube has been directed to, working closely with law-enforcement agencies and traditional leaders, ensure that the repugnant extortionist practice of witch-hunting is immediately brought to an end countrywide, he said.
