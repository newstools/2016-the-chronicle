Midfielder Jordan Henderson will captain England against Spain today, with forward Wayne Rooney not starting the friendly at Wembley. Rooney, skipper for Friday s World Cup qualifying win over Scotland, missed training on Monday with a minor injury. I wouldn t start Wayne in this game, so we ll decide which route to go, said interim boss Gareth Southgate.Henderson, 26, captained England in their 0-0 draw in Slovenia last month when Rooney was dropped to the bench. The key for me is I believe we have several leaders, added Southgate. I don t think we can have just one captain. Too much responsibility has been on Wayne &#8211; we need to share that. Once you have a team of those leaders you can have a lot of success. Tottenham striker Harry Kane will not feature against Spain, having been released from the squad over the weekend as he recovers from injury.The 23-year-old damaged an ankle against Sunderland on 18 September and only returned for 73 minutes of action against Arsenal on 6 November before joining up with the England squad.He was an unused substitute for the 3-0 win over Scotland at Wembley.Southampton left-back Ryan Bertrand also missed training on Monday and, with only 19 England outfield players available, 17-year-old Spurs midfielder Dylan Duncan made up the numbers. There s any different number of ways we can approach the game, said Southgate. For me, it s an opportunity to build on the way we are playing.It s a great challenge in terms of a different style of game. It s a game we have to get tactically right, the way we press a different style of game. We want to build on last few performances, which I think have improved the detail of how we want to play. I don t want to make loads of changes. If we don t keep some consistency then we are not building and are starting again almost. BBC.
