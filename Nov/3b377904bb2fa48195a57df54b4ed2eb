Crystabel Chikayi, Chronicle Reporter SOLUSI University has slashed fees by 10 percent to give relief to students who will be studying during the 2017 academic year. The decision was taken by the Solusi University Council at its recent meeting held on November 21.Solusi University s Public Relations Officer Mr Collen Mahlangu said the fee reduction was meant to accommodate students who were failing to pay the full fees.He said the reduction would also benefit students who deferred their studies in 2016 due to the prevailing economic situation. Considering the tough economy, the institution saw it viable to lower the fees so as to cater for all students from all backgrounds. As an institution we are not concerned about the fees though it is a necessity, we are concerned with providing education to students, said Mr Mahlangu.He said students would have the option to settle fees through payment plans. The payment plan is flexible to encompass everyone, said Mr Mahlangu.He said given the financial difficulties that most of the students are experiencing, the university continues to extend income generating schemes to benefit them.Mr Mahlangu said for example, $50 shall be paid to any student who successfully recruits an undergraduate student to register with the institution which is run by the Seventh Day Adventist church.He said $25 shall be paid to any student who successfully recruits any one block release or trimester student who shall subsequently register with the university. We hope some relief and certainty shall be brought to the students while other measures are being considered for future implementation, said Mr Mahlangu.@cchikayi.
