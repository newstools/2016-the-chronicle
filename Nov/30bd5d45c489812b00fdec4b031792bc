Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent WATER shortages in Bulawayo are a threat to the city s emergency services with the Fire Brigade warning residents that it might be incapacitated to deal with huge infernos. The municipality this week announced the implementation of a 72-hour water shedding regime due to falling water levels in the supply dams.Some suburbs have gone for over a week without water.In an interview, Bulawayo Chief Fire Officer Mr Richard Petersen said the Fire brigade has about 14 000 litres of water in its reserves.He said any fire incidents that would require the brigade to use more than 14 000 litres would be catastrophic. We ve two water carriers at the moment. One of the water carriers carries about 5 000 litres and the other about 9 000 so in such cases we will be hoping the incident will not require usage of more than what we have in terms of water. It s really a crisis, said Mr Petersen.He said the present situation makes it difficult for residents to extinguish fires on their own. We re so thankful of their response when a neighbour is faced by a fire situation. At times when we get there, they would have already extinguished the fire. But in this case, the likelihood of neighbours using their last water to extinguish the fire might not happen, Mr Petersen said.He appealed to residents to continue assisting each other during this difficult period as the Fire brigade will find ways to compensate them for water that they would have used. As a brigade we will definitely find a way of reimbursing that person the water that they would have used to assist the neighbour. They should continue with the good work they ve been doing all along, said Mr Petersen.He said residents should guard against unnecessary fires that threaten their lives and their properties.@nqotshili
