Lovemore Zigara in Gweru ZIFA Central Soccer League (CSL) champions Shabanie Mine wrapped up their season in style by beating Jessie Mine 2 1 in Colleen Bawn at the weekend. The win took the Chinda Boys tally to 69 points to end the season four points clear of second-placed Blanket Mine.Relegated Gweru United were a no show for their final game against Blanket Mine, resulting in the gold miners being awarded the match on a 3 0 score line.Blanket Mine had earlier been awarded three points for their abandoned match against Nichrut last month by the same margin after the Shurugwi-based outfit was found guilty of causing the abandonment of the game.CSL chairman Stanley Chapeta said the region will honour Shabanie Mine at an awards presentation slated for December 18. Generally it was a good season for us as we did not encounter any major challenges. However, we had our fair share of problems which we managed to solve and we hope to have a better season going forward, said Chapeta. We will officially declare Shabanie Mine champions of the region this weekend and after that we are going to present them with the winners shield and medals on 18 December. This is the day we are also going to hold our regional annual general meeting, he said.Following a CSL resolution to increase the number of teams from 16 to 18 next season, the league had a false start when Mvuma-based NM Academy pulled out citing financial challenges.Esigodini-based Habane Sharks also pulled out five weeks into the league after the club s benefactor Baron Dube cited lack of support from the local community.This resulted in the league reverting to 16 before eventually ending with 15 clubs after ZRP Beitbridge were expelled.ResultsKwekwe Sables 0-3 Nichrut, Jessie Mine 1-2 Shabanie Mine, Tongogara 0-0 Ivan Hoe, FC Platinum Under 19 1-1 MSU, Vumbachikwe 2-0 Chrome Stars, Blanket Mine 3-0 Gweru United, Whawha 5-1 ZPC Munyati, ZRP Gwanda 3-0 ZRP BeitbridgeTable P W D L F A GD Pts Shabanie Mine 30 22 3 5 37 11 26 69 Blanket Mine 30 20 5 5 46 18 28 65 Ivan Hoe 30 18 8 4 47 25 22 62 Whawha 30 16 8 6 37 23 14 56 Tongogara 30 14 11 5 38 19 19 53 MSU 30 12 14 5 39 23 16 50 FC Platinum U19 30 12 10 8 30 23 7 47 Nichrut 30 11 8 11 38 31 7 41 Jessie Mine 30 11 5 14 30 36 -6 38 Vumbachikwe 30 10 7 13 23 27 -4 37 ZRP Gwanda 30 10 3 17 32 37 -5 33 ZRP Beitbridge 30 9 4 17 31 50 -19 31 ZPC Munyati 30 5 13 12 34 45 -11 28 Chrome Stars 30 5 8 17 22 40 -18 23 Kwekwe Sables 30 5 6 19 23 52 -29 21 Gweru United 30 2 3 25 13 60 -47 9@lavuzigara1
