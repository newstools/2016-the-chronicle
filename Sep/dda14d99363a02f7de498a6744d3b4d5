Showbiz Correspondent FORMER Ilanga lead guitarist Rodger Mbambo, who died last Sunday, was buried at Luveve Cemetery in Bulawayo on Friday.Mbambo died at the age of 59 at his family home in Makokoba after a long illness. Fellow musician Dino Mudondo, who worked with Mbambo in the early 2000s, said he was shocked to hear of the death. I see him as a musical father and I was so shocked when I heard that he died over the weekend. He helped me a lot and also got me gigs in Bulawayo. We shall surely miss him, said Mudondo.Cape to Cairo proprietor Peter Mubi, who used to hold gigs featuring Mbambo, said his death has left the music industry poorer. He was a jovial person who stood out in his craft. He was a very talented person and he shall be sorely missed. Musicians are a dying breed and DJs have taken over and Mbambo was one of those, said Mubi.Family spokesperson Brian Chiromo said he was grateful to all those who helped the family in their time of grief. The help we got from friends and relatives was very much needed. They gave us financial and emotional support which made the time of grieving easier, said Chiromo.Mbambo, who had been ill for some time, died last week after falling sick during a church service.The talented artiste, who started playing the guitar when he was 10 years old, began his professional music career when he joined Bulawayo jazz group Eye of Liberty in 80s. After a brief stint there, Mbambo moved to Harare where he joined Ilanga in 1986. The highly successful group was comprised of Andy Brown, Don Gumbo (both late) and Busi Ncube.After three years, the group split and Mbambo left with Busi Ncube when she formed Rain. He played with her for 12 years until she left for overseas in 2001. Thereafter, he worked as a session guitarist with notable musicians such as Oliver Mtukudzi, Dino Mudondo and Andy Brown. @bonganinkunzi.
