A number of suicide incidents have been recorded in the past years.Residents around the area believe that the pool is cursed and has some evil spirits even though some religious sects baptise their church members there.Some people have committed suicide by throwing themselves into the pool and others have drowned during baptism sessions.The city council has failed to erect a security wall around the pool to prevent people from accessing the area, rendering it a death trap. @miles_junior&nbsp;
