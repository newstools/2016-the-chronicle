The refurbishment and modernisation of Bata Stores began in 2012.As part of its efforts to retain its customers, the Gweru based shoe manufacturer earlier this year embarked on an in-house training programme for its employees working in its retail outlets. We have also tried to improve the services in our outlets through training our workforce to ensure that they sell better. We call this the Bata 5 step Training Programme which is the basic. We have already completed that and it is giving us positive results, said the Bata managing director.The company employs about 500 employees in its retail outlets. @lavuzigara1
