Chamu MusanhuSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports ReporterUNITED Kingdom based Dynamos legend Chamu Musanhu has predicted a DeMbare victory over Highlanders when the two giants clash at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. Musanhu though was quick to concede that Highlanders have been better on the field of play this season and I only went for Dynamos because its my club . Its going to be a massive encounter, that I can tell you and I think Bosso have been better in terms of performance this season than Dynamos but I will still go for my former club on a 2-1 scoreline but like I said it will be a tough and closely fought affair, said Musanhu in a telephone interview from his base in the UK.The tough defender, meanwhile, called on both sets of fans to embrace the spirit of sportsmanship and accept whatever outcome on the field of play. A match between Bosso and Dynamos is not an ordinary encounter, all eyes will be on it. The two clubs are the leading lights in Zimbabwean football and it is these two that can help develop our football. Bosso and Dembare are rivals but not enemies and their fans should be as such, lets use football to cultivate a culture of unity, said Musanhu.
