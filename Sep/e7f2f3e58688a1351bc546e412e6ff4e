We do recognise that our society is getting more complex with dynamic varying sets of requirements, said Prof Nyagura.He said this presented a challenge that called for a re-think of the nature of the public service the university should provide.Prof Nyagura said to that end, the university s focus should be more on socialisation of knowledge by making sure that the university produced highly-qualified professionals and that the best research results were transferred to society.He said the UZ was also open to capture the knowledge generated by society so as to sustain and further develop the intellectual and cultural base of the country. In this endeavour, we have committed ourselves to participate in national projects that empower our country to be competitive regionally, continentally and internationally, said Prof Nyagura.He said in addition, the university also reviewed its curriculum to promote innovation, application of science and technology and entrepreneurship. Our focus is to produce graduates with a strong foundation in science and technology and with problem solving and analytical skills, he said.Some of the training incorporated include Forensic Science, Geospatial Intelligence and Aeronautical Engineering.Prof Nyagura said the university had also excelled in the development of GIS (Geographic Information System) and Earth Observation Sciences.
