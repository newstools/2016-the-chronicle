Lovemore Zigara in GweruZIFA Central Soccer League (CSL) table anchors Gweru United s miseries continue to mount after they were found guilty by the league s disciplinary committee of causing the abandonment of their match against ZPC Munyati at Ascot Stadium early in the season. They were found guilty of having caused the abandonment of the match after ZPC Munyati arrived at Ascot for the match only to find the pitch waterlogged after a council employee had forgotten to close the water valves.CSL chairman, Stanley Chapeta said Pisa Pisa were directed by the disciplinary committee to either reimburse ZPC Munyati $3 000 for the expenses the power generators incurred in preparation of the match by August 31 or have the match forfeited on a three nil score line. The deadline for them to reimburse ZPC Munyati lasped on Wednesday and communication we got from both parties is that Gweru United had not honoured terms of the judgment hence they will forfeit the match on a three nil score line. This will be reflected on the log table for next week, said Chapeta.The Gweru based outfit play Kwekwe Sables tomorrow at Wilson Fields hoping for a change in fortunes as they have only won two matches.Adding to Gweru United s woes is the fact that they lost half of their players to other clubs during the midseason break.Meanwhile, giant killers Nichrut will be hoping to complete a double over leaders Shabanie Mine when the two sides meet tomorrow at Peak Mine Stadium.Nichrut handed the asbestos miners their only defeat at Maglas Stadium so far this season when they edged the Chinda Boys one nil.FixturesToday: MSU vs Blanket Mine (MSU), Whawha vs Vumbachikwe (Whawha), ZRP Gwanda vs Chrome Stars (Pelandaba), Tongogara vs ZRP Beitbridge (Battlefields), FC Platinum Under 19 vs Jessie Mine (Mandava)Tomorrow: Nichrut vs Shabanie Mine (Peak Stadium), ZPC Munyati vs Ivan Hoe (Munyati), Gweru United vs Kwekwe Sables (Wilson Fields).@lavuzigara1
