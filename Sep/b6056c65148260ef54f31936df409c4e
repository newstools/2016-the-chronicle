Grace Chingoma, Harare Bureau VETERAN Warriors forward Cuthbert Malajila insists the current national team is made up of soldiers who are ready to overcome their poor travel arrangements and deliver once they get to Conakry for their showdown with Guinea tomorrow. The Warriors are scheduled to face the Sylie Nationale tomorrow night in a final Group L qualifier at Stade du 28 September tomorrow but they were still holed up in Harare by last night.Poor traveling arrangements returned to haunt the Warriors, who found themselves in similar circumstances ahead of their opening fixture away to Malawi where they ended up travelling by road to Blantyre and arriving hours before their match against the Flames.Malajila, who is one of the most experienced players in the team, said this setback would not move them as they have become used to these travel arrangements . We are soldiers, we have done it before but I think this is a long journey and maybe it is going to affect us but we don t want to put it in our minds and we don t want it to affect us because there is nothing we can do as players but have to solider on, said Malajila.The Bidvest Wits forward said he is still confident that they can come up with a good result in Conakry. The guys have been focused for the whole week and the only problem is those who are not present, we don t know what they are doing but they are professionals and know what to do, this will not affect us. We are confident that we will have a positive result and we want to finish this campaign without a defeat, he said.The former Dynamos striker said it is important that they gain a winning momentum as they have already begun preparations for the Nations Cup. This game is important, we will know what it is like in the West African country, and we have five west African countries that have already qualified, so we are preparing already for Afcon and everyone knows what is expected of them, so everyone is focused and we have to keep working hard as Afcon is coming soon, in about five months time, so there is not much time left, said Malajila.Malajila has started this season well after moving to Wits from Mamelodi Sundowns where he was not getting enough game time and the striker said he believes the move was very wise decision. For me it was a good decision that I made because at Mamelodi Sundowns last season I never played many games. I chose a team where I can compete and play again. There are also a lot of players at Wits but I know I am going to compete and play, said Malajila.
