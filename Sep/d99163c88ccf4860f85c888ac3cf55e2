Two goals from Phikisani Moyo and Dominic Nyika enabled Laduma to overcome Safeguard, who scored through Sikhumbuzo Moyo and Sibangilizwe Mpofu.Laduma FC almost conceded a goal nine seconds into the match when their goalkeeper failed to deal with a back pass and the ball went within inches of the upright.Safeguard opened the scoring in the 18th minute when Sikhumbuzo Moyo converted from a spot kick after a Laduma defender had handled in the box. However, Laduma levelled matters seven minutes later through Phikisani Moyo to make up for a number of earlier missed chances.Laduma then took the lead in the 35th minute through Nyika, who came face-to-face with the goalkeeper and scored with ease.Safeguard came back from the breather highly charged and levelled matters four minutes into the second half through Mpofu. Laduma s Moyo then sealed victory in the 75th minute. I am happy that we have qualified for the semi-finals, but I won t say I am happy with the team s performance today, said Laduma coach Dominic Sibanda. This is not the kind of game we usually play. We missed a lot of chances in the first half and we got punished for that when we went a goal down. We have learnt from our mistakes and are going to work on them and would hopefully have resolved them when we play our next match.
