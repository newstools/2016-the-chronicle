Richard Muponde, Gwanda Correspondent THE Manama tarred road will extend to the new Mlambapheli Border Post to ease access to Botswana for trade and family visitations, a minister has said. The Minister of Rural Development, Promotion and Preservation of National Culture and Heritage, Cde Abednego Ncube said in an interview that the tarmac will reach the new border which was opened four months ago. As you have seen construction is underway. Heavy machinery such as front-end loaders and graders are on the ground to prepare for the tarmac from Bethel to Tuli Bridge. After they reach that point, the tarring will be extended to the new border, he said.Minister Ncube said the tarring of the road will help many people who rely on Manama Mission Hospital for treatment. Manama Hospital serves Beitbridge South, Matobo South and Gwanda South and all these villagers will get easy access to the medical facility.Even those who will be transferred to Gwanda will also benefit. This is a milestone development which was brought by our government led by President Robert Mugabe, said Minister Ncube.He said the construction of the road would bring employment opportunities to the people of Gwanda as all the menial jobs have been reserved for locals. Our children will get employment here. The contractor has been told that he should employ locals for menial labour. He will only bring technical experts but all other labour will come from the people of Gwanda, he said.The construction of the more than 20 kilometre stretch from Bethel to Tuli Bridge is being funded by the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure Development.In March, Transport Minister Joram Gumbo promised the people of Gwanda that he would make sure that the road was tarred up to Manama Mission Hospital.Two months ago, the District Development Fund (DDF) finished constructing a new 10-kilometre road to the new border from Mashaba Business Centre. @richardmuponde
