Guluva 7Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya, Showbiz Correspondent NKANYISO Moyo aka Guluva 7 set tongues wagging at the recently held Midlands Music Awards in Gweru after he bagged the best hip-hop album award, despite being based in Bulawayo. The awards are strictly meant for artistes from the Midlands province, but this did not stop the Bulawayo-based word smith, from snatching the award for his album Colour of Dreams.When the nominations were made several artistes from Midlands protested, arguing that organisers of the event did not do much research on Guluva 7.He beat other artistes from the province who were in the same category &#8211; TupAc Shakur Afriken, Singles Collection Crystalefire, and Lazarus Ur Highness and Chibhachura Di Truth. Well what can I say, the album spoke for itself and people listened. Remember it s all about the audience, said the visibly elated rapper.He added that people who were quick to dismiss him as a Bulawayo rapper were showing ignorance of his background. I grew up in the Midlands, to be specific Torwood, Redcliff, so for people to claim that I am not from Midlands it shows that they don t understand who Guluva 7 is, he said.Initially when the nominations were made the organiser of Midlands Music Awards, Mavis Koslek, had a torrid time explaining why artistes outside Midlands were part of the list, and dismissed such claims as sour grapes. It s obvious that those who re complaining didn t make it to the nominees list. We only work on submitted material and those that didn t submit material can t expect to be nominated, Koslek said.
