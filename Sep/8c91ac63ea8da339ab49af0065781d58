Sean WilliamsRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter TOP order batsman Sean Williams has rejoined Matabeleland Tuskers Cricket Franchise from Midwest Rhinos where he spent a season. A bold and dynamic left-handed batsman when in form, Williams, who played a significant role in Tuskers fourth Logan Cup win since the start of franchise cricket in 2009, dumped Tuskers for the 2015/16 season and joined the Kwekwe-based side.Williams is part of about 30 players attending Tuskers pre-season training at Queens Sports Club.Wayne James, Tuskers coach, confirmed Williams return and said his availability would strengthen their batting line-up. We ve started our pre-season and as it is we re working on fitness because we have a big pool of players which we should trim to about 15 to 20 in the coming weeks. We re also waiting for a couple of guys that are still overseas to join us. Our former captain Williams has bounced back and will be playing for us this season. This will certainly be a boost to our batting unit, said James.Besides Williams, some of the top players at Tuskers pre-season training include John Nyumbu, Christopher Mpofu, Brian Vitori, wicketkeeper Richmund Mutumbami and Luke Jongwe.Seamer Tawanda Mupariwa, top order batsman Brian Chari and South African-based pace bowler Njabulo Ncube are also training with Tuskers.Overseas-based players yet to join camp are Tafara Mupariwa, Steve Chimamhiwa, Keith Dabengwa and Mbekezeli Mabuza.Tuskers will appoint a new skipper for the 2016/17 season that starts next month following the departure of captain Godwill Mamhiyo for South Africa.Despite the loss of his captain, James remains confident that the Tuskers squad can reclaim glory.Tuskers came second to Mashonaland Eagles in the Logan Cup. Eagles also won the 2015/16 season s Pro50 title. It s a strong squad we have, but the problem with such squads is that they struggle to perform in a positive manner and we need time to get the players to gel and do the right things. Another challenge is that these players are not together for the better part of the season due to national duty, but we ll see how we go about it, said James.@ZililoR
