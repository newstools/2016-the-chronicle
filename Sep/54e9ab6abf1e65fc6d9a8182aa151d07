The Officer Commanding Bulawayo West district Chief Superintendent Mthokozisi Manzini-Moyo, however, refused to divulge the number of police officers to be deployed but sources say the figure will be more than double the figure usually deployed to matches at the Stadium.The last game pitting Highlanders and How Mine had 100 police officers. We will not mention figures but we are going to make adequate deployment on the day. As police we are ready for the match and can confidently assure peace loving football people that they will enjoy peace and tranquility on the day, said Chief Supt Manzini-Moyo.Bulawayo West district s top cop encouraged the fans to go to the stadium and enjoy the proceedings without any fear. Let the match be treated as a social event, we implore football fans to desist from bringing missiles into the stadium. After the match they can then go and enjoy in their various places of interest, said Chief Supt Manzini-Moyo.An increase in the police numbers will obviously hit the home team hard on the pocket but club secretary general Emmet Ndlovu said they would not want to compromise security. The police know better when it comes to security issues, said Ndlovu.Police officers deployed to matches are paid by the home team.
