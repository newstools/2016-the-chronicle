The local authority has engaged Manyara and Associates, a local contractor as well as Mud Hut of South Africa for the ambitious project: a civic centre, a five-star hotel, a shopping mall, convention centre and a hospital facility among other structures.Finer details about the project are still sketchy as Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube said the deal was still under discussion with the relevant authorities. We have a MoU but we can t talk about it now because we need to report to Government first and then update a full council meeting, he said.He said full details on the whole project will be availed at a full council meeting at the end of this month.According to the latest council report, the MoU has since been signed between council and Mud Hut after councillors okayed the multi-million dollar complex deal. Management sought approval from council to sign the MoU which was granted as the local authority agreed to engage Mud Hut and Benbally as funders while Manyara and Associates is the project proponents and CBZ Bank the project advisor, reads part of the council report.A tender to do a feasibility study was awarded to Hospitality and Tourism Industry (HTI) consultants of South Africa and the cost was put at $46 000.The Government is also planning a conference centre between Victoria Falls International Airport and town centre which will house state-of-the-art facilities such as hotels, offices, conference rooms as it seeks to make Victoria Falls the country s conference capital.@ncubeleon
