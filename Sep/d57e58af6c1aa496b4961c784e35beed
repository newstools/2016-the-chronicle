Noel Munzabwa from Mbabane Swaziland WARRIORS assistant coach Saul Chaminuka has found a new home at Swaziland s MTN National First Division side Matsapha United. Chaminuka was expected to arrive in the kingdom s industrial hub of Matsapha yesterday, according to his handler Dingani Maduna. Chaminuka has got the Matsapha United job, said Maduna. He is coming in more as a football consultant type of technical department leader and is expected to structure his desired technical department and empower colleagues in that department. Maduna claimed that Chaminuka would become the highest paid coach in Swaziland football, although he declined to divulge any figures.He said the new coach would also be entitled to winning bonuses and holiday allowances on a performance-based contract that also takes into consideration his involvement with the Warriors. Basically he will be expected to garner 10 points from his first five matches, with promotion to the MTN Premier League as the team s target, Maduna said.He said the latest developments would not rock the Warriors 2017 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Gabon. We are not rocking the Warriors boat, but have taken into consideration his role as assistant coach.In fact, we have always considered that and even delayed his assumption of duty. We were aware he was away with the Warriors in Guinea last weekend and as such, special provision will be made for next year s finals in Gabon as the club and Swaziland soccer at large will benefit from that exposure. Matsapha United, formerly known as RSSC United, has taken local football by storm, with their buying spree under the directorship of two businessmen, Sipho Shongwe and former senator Victor Malambe, who recently invested R2 million into the project.They have lured some Swaziland Premier League players, such as Vusumuzi Zungu, Jimmoh Moses and Sabelo Gamedze from Mbabane Highlanders, among their signings.They also roped in Mozambican Mathews Mandlazi as their interim head coach.Dubbed the new Mbabane Highlanders , after their directors openly declared their love for the capital city giants, Matsapha United have also lured two former Mbabane Highlanders officials Celucolo Dlamini as chief executive officer and Sfiso Mnisi as logistics manager.The ambitious side is based at the luxurious Madala Lodge in Matsapha, which is owned by Shongwe, making them the first local team with a players village.@NoelMunzabwa.
