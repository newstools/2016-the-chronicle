Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Court ReporterHIGHLANDERS Football Club board member and retired Hillside Teacher s College principal, Mr Elkanah Dube (67), has approached the High Court in Bulawayo seeking to divorce his 30-year-old wife whom he alleges is a drunkard and of a violent disposition . Mr Dube and his wife, Rejoice (nee Ndlovu) wedded on September 7, 2014 under Chapter 5:11 of the Marriages Act.No children were born out of the marriage.They, however, each have children from previous marriages.According to summons before the Bulawayo High Court, the couple has been locked in a long standing domestic dispute.Mr Dube, who is a self-actor, filed an application for a decree of divorce citing irreconcilable differences with his youthful wife.He said his marriage had irretrievably broken down such that there were no prospects of restoring it to a normal relationship. Mr Dube accused his wife of allegedly going on nocturnal drinking sprees and returning home several days later. The defendant regularly goes on drinking sprees and comes back in the morning or takes several days to return home. She is also violent and this is inconsistent with the institution of a normal marriage relationship, said Mr Dube. The parties have not shared conjugal rights for a period in excess of 12 months and as a result I have lost love and affection for the defendant and do not wish to remain married to her. During the subsistence of the marriage, the couple acquired household property and two cars.The veteran sports administrator wants the court to share their matrimonial property and equally share money owed to debtors.@mashnets
