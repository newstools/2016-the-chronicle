Tanaka Mrewa, Chronicle Reporter PUMULA South residents are being terrorised by baboons that raid their houses from a forest around Khami Dam in search of food. Talking to a Chronicle news crew yesterday, the residents said although the baboons were not violent yet, they fear that things could get worse and there are fears of the spread of diseases.They said the baboons invade the area in groups of up to 30 as early as 9AM each day.Some are a menace as they climb on rooftops while others roam the streets scavenging for food.Mrs Priscilla Mlotshwa, a resident, said they were living in fear of the animals. We fear for our children. They may not be violent now because they still find food, but what would happen when they come in larger numbers than they already are and food starts running out for them? wondered Mrs Mlotshwa.Mrs Princess Bhebhe said they fear for their health as they are not sure if the baboons are afflicted by some diseases. Animals belong to the forest and once they start coming to where people are then there s a problem. The other day they bit my melon on the veranda. Food is hard to come by these days so I couldn t throw it away. I simply cut away the bitten piece and ate the rest. We pray that these animals don t bring us diseases, said Mrs Bhebhe.She said at one time a child who was coming from the shops lost a loaf of bread after he was attacked by a baboon. May the community leaders take an initiative to help us because this is not healthy, we can t live with baboons, she said.A resident who spoke on condition of anonymity said the baboons are not afraid of women and children. These baboons will be coming from Khami Dam. The other problem is they only flee from men. They are not scared of children and women.There s a day when one baboon charged towards a child who was eating bread. It pushed him to the ground and snatched his bread, he said.@tannytkay
