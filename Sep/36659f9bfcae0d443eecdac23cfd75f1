Suspended deputy mayor, Clr Gift BandaVusumuzi Dube, Chronicle Reporter DETAILS have emerged on the various properties Bulawayo city councillors allegedly corruptly dispersed among themselves with revelations that land and property grabbing- enmasse- within the local authority became intense starting May last year. According to a report by a committee from the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, councillors owe a total of $662 299 as they have defaulted in paying for the corruptly-acquired properties and those that they are also leasing in violation of council regulations and provisions.Council has further lost $3 278 in rented leases which were offered to councillors but have not yet commenced paying for the monthly rental.So deep is the corruption that even a former councillor, Mr Edward Manning, allegedly benefitted from the illicit deals which saw him purchase a stand on 40 percent discount, a facility only open to serving councillors due to a ministerial directive.Council procedure bars development on land before one pays at least 25 percent of the purchase price but councillors were allegedly developing their acquisitions, most of them before paying anything.Five councillors deemed to be the most corrupt, were suspended on Tuesday and only five out of the city s 29 councillors were found clean.The 24 dirty councillors will soon appear before a tribunal.The pejorative report notes that suspended deputy mayor, Clr Gift Banda, in addition to the 3,5 hectare Ascot stand for the construction of town houses, also got a lease for land to construct a social club at Hume Park.He is accused of using his influence to secure a lease for the property. The lease was done without following laid down council procedures which include going to tender. The Hume Park stand was an application to lease land to construct a social club between Second and Fourth Avenue; along Samuel Parirenyatwa Street, by a company called Entertainment Headquarters. The application was presented by a company directly linked to Gift Banda as can be seen from the project proposal in which Gift Banda signed as a principal partner, on the council minutes dated 3/09/2014, it is indicated that he declared his interest and recused himself from the proceedings, reads part of the report.
