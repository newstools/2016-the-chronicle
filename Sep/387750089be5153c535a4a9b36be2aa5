Minister Walter ChidhakwaBianca Mlilo, Business ReporterMINES and Mining Development Minister Walter Chidhakwa and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor Dr John Mangudya are today expected to address players in the mining sector at a conference in Zvishavane. The one-day conference, dubbed the Great Dyke Business Investment Forum will be attended by Chamber of Mines Zimbabwe chief executive Mr Isaac Kwesu and Mimosa Holdings executive chairman Mr Winston Chitando.Representatives from the Federation of Small Scale Miners, Buy Zimbabwe Campaign and bankers would also attend the meeting.One of the organisers, Buy Zimbabwe Campaign and Ya FM chief executive officer Mr Munyaradzi Hwengwere yesterday told Business Chronicle the meeting was an attempt to harness the potential that the Great Dyke has for the benefit of local people. We realised that the Great Dyke, as much as it s known for its minerals, very little has been done to unlock its potential. There is no database of small scale miners, the economic potential of the area has not been ascertained and there are no schools to show for all the richness of the area, said Mr Hwengwere. We ve to invest in knowing the place and unlocking its potential. Big companies and small scale miners will come together on that day. The reason why we invited Dr Mangudya is because RBZ plays a critical role in the mining sector in terms of exports and incentives. The Great Dyke is host to many minerals including gold, silver, chromium, platinum, nickel and asbestos.@BiancaMlilo&nbsp;
