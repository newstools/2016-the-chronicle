Thupeyo Muleya in Beitbridge Border Strikers 0-0 FC Platinum CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League whipping boys Border Strikers held log leaders FC Platinum to a goalless draw at Dulivhadzimu Stadium yesterday.Border Strikers matched the title contenders man-for-man and could have snatched the lead in the 25th minute through Clever Mutendebvure had his powerful shot not crashed against the upright.Mutendebvure threatened again five minutes later when the visitors defence failed to clear their lines, but his effort was saved by FC Platinum goalkeeper Petros Mhari.The home team kept piling pressure forcing visiting coach Norman Mapeza to pull out the out of sorts Hillary Bakacheza and replacing him with Ishmael Wadi in the 30th minute.Mhari made a number of important interventions that kept FC Platinum in the game.Mapeza said his boys failed to convert a lot of chances, which cost them maximum points. We failed to come to the party. We could have won the match. There are some games like this one which we feel we should have won. We had better chances to win, but things like these happen in football. Border strikers are fighting relegation and they came all out attacking us and a point for them matters the most, said Mapeza.Border Strikers coach Luke Masomere, who is just six days old at the Beitbridge-based log anchors, said he was a man on a mission. This is my first game at home and we have improved our play comparing to the way we played against Harare City last week. I am here to work and I like challenges. We are going out of the relegation zone and the idea is to fight up to the last game of the season, said Masomere.
