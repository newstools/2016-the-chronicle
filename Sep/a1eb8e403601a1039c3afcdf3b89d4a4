Ndux JuniorAndile Tshuma, Chronicle Reporter NDUX Junior (real name Witness Malaba), son of the late Ndux Malax, was robbed of $20, R300, a Samsung smart phone and car radio at his Nkulumane home in Bulawayo earlier this month. &nbsp;The artiste, who was once knifed on the thigh during a botched robbery in Johannesburg in 2012, apparently walked into his home on September 1 this year and found the alleged thief at it. Mysteriously, this was not the robber s first visit as he had also visited the same home on the previous day. On the second day, he got away with nothing as he was caught red handed forcing him to flee.The alleged robber, Justin Tshabalala (20) of Old Luveve suburb, appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Tancy Dube yesterday charged with two counts of unlawful entry and theft in aggravating circumstances .Prosecuting, Margret Takawira told the court that Tshabalala allegedly broke into Malaba s premises on August 31 and September 1.On August 31, he went unnoticed, but on September 1 at about 6PM, Malaba (Ndux Junior) was surprised to see the main door, which he had repaired on the same day, wide open.Tshabalala was allegedly caught red handed in the house by Malaba. The complainant then went inside to check if all was well and was shocked to see the accused. The accused bolted out of the sitting room and jumped over the precast wall with the complainant in hot pursuit, said the prosecutor.The entire neighbourhood allegedly joined the chase after Malaba started calling out thief, thief to raise alarm.An angry public gave instant justice, leading Tshabalala to sustain injuries, before they effected a citizen arrest. Tshabalala was hospitalised after he was beaten by Malaba s neighbours.The accused was found with a total of 73 duplicate door keys, 44 duplicate padlock keys, a screw driver and three wardrobe keys in his possession.However, Tshabalala was not asked to plead and was remanded out of custody to October 4. &#8211; @andile_tshuma
