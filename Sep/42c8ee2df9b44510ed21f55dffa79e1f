Andile Tshuma, Court Reporter A Western Commonage Magistrate has described a man who hit his neighbour with a brick and attempted to stab him with a kitchen knife following a misunderstanding triggered by his girlfriend as stupid. World Ncube (21) of Entumbane Suburb appeared before Mr Stephen Ndhlovu facing assault charges.He was fined $50, but if he fails to pay by September 30 he will be jailed for three months.Ncube pleaded not guilty to the charge but later said he was sorry about his actions. I am sorry. I only meant to protect my girlfriend, said Ncube.Magistrate Ndhlovu said Ncube was foolish to attack someone over a girlfriend who may as well end up dumping him. If it was your wife, it would be understandable, but a girlfriend who can leave you anytime while you are rotting in prison, wise up, he said. There is a very thin line between a hero and a foolish, stupid person. In this case you were very stupid. Prosecuting, Mr Kenneth Shava said Ncube went to the house of Mr Mqondisi Ncube (20), his neighbour, armed with a knife.He asked him why he had allegedly assaulted his girlfriend. On August 16 at around 7PM, accused person went to the complainant s place and started accusing him of having assaulted his (accused s) girlfriend. The complainant told him to leave him alone as he had not assaulted his girlfriend, said the prosecutor. The accused person then took a kitchen knife intending to stab the complainant. He sustained bruises on his neck. The court heard that Mqondisi attempted to run away from his home, but Ncube picked a brick and hit him on the back.-@andile_tshuma
