nTanaka Mrewa, Court Reporter A PASTOR from Cowdray Park in Bulawayo has been sentenced to three months in jail over maintenance arrears. A court heard that Gordon Ncube (45) had a maintenance order granted against him in April this year ordering him to $137 per month for the upkeep of his three children.Ncube had not paid anything since the date the order was granted.In August, he paid and remained with a $213 shortfall.He pleaded guilty to a failure to pay maintenance charge.Bulawayo Magistrate Miss Evelyn Mashavakure sentenced Ncube to three months in prison, wholly suspended on condition that he pays $213 before October 15 this year. Your Worship I m sorry for the arrears that I have accumulated. I wish to give my children a better life but I don t have any source of income. I live on donations in kind and the little amounts that people bring as offering, said Ncube.He told the court that he realises about $150 a month. From that amount your worship I pay rentals of $40 where I stay and $60 where we fellowship. So I am left with $50 which has to cater for my groceries and bills. I m trying all that I can to pay up maintenance for my children. Miss Mashavakure said it is mandatory for him to look after his children. You being employed or not is not your children s problem. As a father you are supposed to take responsibility for your children. A court gave you that order and if you had realised you could no longer afford, you should have come back and applied for a variation downwards, she said.Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo prosecuted.@tannytkay
