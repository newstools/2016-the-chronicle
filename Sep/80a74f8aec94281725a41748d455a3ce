Chicken Inn Football Club striker Obadiah TarumbwaTanaka Mrewa, Court Reporter CHICKEN Inn Football Club striker Obadiah Tarumbwa has been sentenced to five months in jail for failure to pay maintenance for his two children. Tarumbwa, who is in maintenance arrears of $543, was arraigned before Bulawayo Magistrate Miss Evelyn Mashavakure last Friday.He pleaded guilty to a contempt of court charge.Tarumbwa pleaded with the court to give him time to settle his arrears saying he is facing financial challenges. My team is not paying me enough money Your Worship. As it is I m being paid per game that I play. I m no longer getting the same amount I was getting when I was at Highlanders. I ll do my best to settle my debt, said Tarumbwa.Miss Mashavakure, in passing sentence, said Tarumbwa should take responsibility and make sure that he provides for his children. You are a father and your children are your responsibility. You have to find that money and settle your arrears. This court sentences you to five months in jail wholly suspended on condition that you pay $543 by October 30, 2016, said Miss Mashavakure. Tarumbwa and his wife Patience have been frequenting the maintenance courts lately over their two children s upkeep.In August this year, Patience was granted an upward variation of $316 per month for both children from $200 that had been granted by the High court.This was prompted by her complaint that Tarumbwa was not looking after their children.She said their first born child had started school and the younger one was asthmatic, hence more money was needed to cater for the child s medical needs.Prosecuting, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo told the court that Tarumbwa owes $232 for June and $316 for July.@tannytkay.
