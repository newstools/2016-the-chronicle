Playing at home is not always easy as we need points more, we are happy that we managed to win the match. The boys played as a unit and we hope this is going to motivate them to work even harder. We need a strong finish in the race and performances like these are good for the team. We are now shifting our focus to prepare for the Highlanders game set for the weekend. We will continue to work hard and the boys are now confident enough, said Ndiraya.Chapungu coach John Nyikadzino gave credit to the home side s first half performance in which he believes they were better than his side. We lost but it was a good game they got their advantage in the first half where they played well and after the breather we were all over them. They utilised their second chance in the second half to beat us but our finishing needs to be worked on before we host Mutare City at Ascot. We will try hard to do well in our next assignment, said Nyikadzino.
