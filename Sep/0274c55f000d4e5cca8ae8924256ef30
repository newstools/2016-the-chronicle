Michel TemerMichel Temer, Brazil s former vice president, has been sworn in as the country s new president, a few hours after the country s Senate voted to remove Dilma Rousseff from office.Temer (75) raised his hand and swore to uphold the constitution, drawing loud applause from his conservative supporters at Wednesday s ceremony in a packed Senate chamber. He is expected to stay in power until the next scheduled election in late 2018.Temer promised a new era of government for Brazil. Today we inaugurate a new era of two years and four months to see out the current presidential mandate, Temer told his ministers at a televised cabinet meeting.Al Jazeera s Lucia Newman, reporting from the capital, Brasilia, said the new president now carried all the weight of this country on his shoulders. We are talking about a massive $60bn deficit, the worst recession this country has been in, double-digit inflation and millions of people out of work. Earlier on Wednesday, 61 of 81 senators voted to impeach suspended president Rousseff, after a five-day trial and a lengthy overnight debate. They decided to interrupt the mandate of a president who had committed no crime. They have convicted an innocent person and carried out a parliamentary coup, Rousseff said in a statement following the Senate vote.Speaking to reporters, Jose Eduardo Cardozo, Rousseff s lawyer, said the former president would appeal against her impeachment. But several motions filed to the country s highest court throughout the impeachment proceedings have failed.In a separate vote later on Wednesday, senators decided not to ban Rousseff from seeking a public office for the next eight years.Rousseff, from the leftist Workers Party, is accused of taking illegal state loans to patch budget holes in 2014, masking the country s problems as it slid into its deepest recession in decades.
