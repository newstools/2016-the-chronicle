Teenage HadebeRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter NATIONAL team and Chicken Inn FC central defender Teenage Hadebe is stuck at the defending champions, at least for now after his intended move to Kaizer Chiefs fell through. South Africa s transfer window closed last Wednesday and by deadline day, Chiefs and Chicken Inn were yet to agree on contractual issues. Hadebe s handlers, Chicken Inn and renowned agent Gibson Mahachi remain confident of clinching the deal with Chiefs and yesterday said the deal was still on the table. The transfer window in South Africa has closed and Hadebe will be moving in December. He will certainly go, said Chicken Inn chairman Lifa Ncube.The towering defender, who can also play at left-back, was on the Warriors bench for the dead-rubber Total Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against out-of-contention Guinea at Stade du 28 Septembre in Conakry on Sunday. Zimbabwe lost the tie 0-1.According to South African football publication Kick-Off, Hadebe, who uses his height to great effect on set-pieces, made the grade and was viewed as the right candidate to complement Chiefs central defence that boasts of the injured Erick Mathoho, Daniel Cardoso, Lorenzo Gordinho, Ramahlwe Mphahlele and Siyanda Xulu.Hadebe s agent Mahachi told Chronicle Sport yesterday that they expect the deal to be finalised soon. The deal is on the table and we re still negotiating. Chiefs hasn t told us they re no longer interested in the defender and once everything is agreed on, Chiefs will have a final say on whether he can continue at Chicken Inn until the next window or not, but we will let you know, Mahachi said.If his move materialises, Hadebe will join countrymen Willard Katsande, Mitchelle Katsvairo and Edmore Chirambadare at the South African glamour side. Katsvairo and Chirambadare completed their moves to Chiefs from Chicken Inn in June, both signing three-year deals. @ZililoR
