Zimbabweans whose thrust now is to turn around the economy, should not be detracted by agents of regime change who are organising violent demonstrations mostly in Harare. During the past few weeks, the country has witnessed violent demonstrations which have left behind a trail of destruction in Harare and Beitbridge.The opposition political parties and other agents of regime change that seem to have run out of ideas on how to remove the Zanu-PF led government from power, have resorted to use of violence to cause anarchy with the hope of making the country ungovernable.The opposition parties irked by the recent moves by government to make the country an investment destination of choice for both foreign and local investors, have resorted to violence to scare away potential investors. It is therefore pleasing to note that Zanu-PF members are aware of the plot hence they have refused to play into the hands of the enemy.The opposition parties supporters and their regime change partners are deliberately provoking Zanu-PF supporters by destroying property and attacking innocent citizens going about their daily business. The President, Cde Mugabe, said Zanu-PF members should, instead of retaliating, craft peaceful strategies to counter violent protests being perpetrated by the opposition.Cde Mugabe who was addressing members of the Politburo on Wednesday, said there was a need for the party to come up with strategies to counter the violent demonstrations as opposed to retaliating. We want at this juncture to commend Zimbabweans in other cities and towns who have realised that the opposition political parties that have resorted to violent demonstrations just want to use them for their own aggrandisement and as such have refused to join the demonstrations.Harare residents, we want to believe, have now realised the futility of engaging in these senseless demonstrations which have achieved nothing but just worsened the plight of the already struggling residents. Those who were worst hit by the past violent demonstrations were the vendors whose stalls were destroyed and wares looted.Zimbabwe is not a doomed or failed state as the opposition parties and agents of regime change want us to believe. It is a fact that Zimbabwe is endowed with abundant natural resources that can make a difference but this is only possible if potential investors are confident that their investments will be secure.It is therefore incumbent upon each and every Zimbabwean to act responsibly and refuse to be used by the country s detractors to disturb peace, a prerequisite for economic development.
