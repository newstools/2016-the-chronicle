Showbiz Reporter ZIMBABWE designer Sidumiso Tshuma of the clothing brand Shadow by Sidumiso, won the Best African Menswear Collection at the Durban Fashion Fair Fashion Awards in South Africa over the weekend. The Bulawayo-born designer s Knight themed collection impressed judges at the fashion fair during the Fashion Recognition Awards that marked the end of the five day fashion showcase that began on August 30.An excited Tshuma said he was elated. I m extremely happy, although am still in shock from the entire experience. It was unexpected considering the incredible fellow designers who showcased; Africa has outstanding talent. I have so much respect for Abrantie the Gentleman, Paledi Segapo, Terrence Bray, Clemas from Nigeria and a whole lot of menswear designers that keep pushing African menswear to the world, said Tshuma.Tshuma, who was showcasing for the third time at the fashion fair, did so alongside fellow countryman Nkanyeziyethu Malunga of GANU clothing brand.Explaining how he came up with his Knight collection, Tshuma said working on the collection challenged his designer prowess. My collection is a mixture of woollen material, suiting, jacket material and some metallic in all shades of grey. The collection represents a strong being and cuts through issues of colour by having the colours incorporated being different shades of grey. A knight is a strong person who pushes through no matter what, it just portrays how we as Zimbabweans and Africans, fight through life in our everyday struggles and beauties, said Tshuma.The talented designer got to dress South African Idols Judge Somizi also known as Somgaga last year at the same event.Durban Fashion Fair is one of the leading Fashion Events in Africa and it attracts the stature of internationally recognised fashion weeks. The fashion event has been running for five years and it is attended by a thousand fashion buyers, textile companies, fashionistas, media and industry players.
