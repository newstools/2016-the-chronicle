Andile Tshuma, Court ReporterA BULAWAYO man employed as a security guard has been jailed for five years for stealing vehicle spare parts worth over $11 000 from his employer. Emmanuel Sithwala (28) yesterday appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndhlovu and pleaded guilty to theft charges.Sithwala stole from Matebezi Project in Kelvin North Industrial area last month.Magistrate Ndhlovu said the security guard breached the trust that was bestowed on him to look after the property. Through you, I want to convey a strong message to other potential criminals that we will not condone people who steal from their employer, whatever the circumstances. You are therefore sentenced to five years in jail, said the magistrate.Six months of his sentence were suspended on condition of good behaviour and 18 months were suspended on condition that he restitutes his employer $10 900 by December 31.In mitigation, Sithwala said he committed the crime because he wanted to sell the property and buy food. I am really sorry I made a mistake. I thought that it was just useless scrap metal that is why I took and used it. I did not know that he (employer) cared about the things that I took. I just wanted to buy food, said Sithwala.The magistrate wondered if it was true that the security guard wanted to buy food worth more than $11 000. How did you want to raise money for food by stealing property worth such a hefty sum of money? I really wonder what kind of food is worth that much, said Mr Ndhlovu.Prosecuting, Mr Kenneth Shava said only $180 was recovered from the $11 080 worth of property that Sithwala stole Matebezi Project. On an unknown date in August 2016 at Matebezi Project in Kelvin North, Sithwala unlawfully took six bus window panels, three gear boxes, two engine blocks, 12 brake shoes, eight Rofa miller rollers and four fly wheel spring, he said.Mr Shava said the employer discovered the property was missing from the company s premises last Thursday.@andile_tshuma
