Adequate SoundsFrom Melissa Mpofu (in Harare) LAST year s Chibuku Road to Fame first runners up, Adequate Sounds, who lost to afro jazz group outfit Black Sight emerged winners at this year s contest. Heavily inspired by sungura ace, Alick Macheso the eight-member Harare band was very committed as they, for a second time, outshone nine other bands which had competed at the Harare provincial final last month. That for them was the toughest part as the rest was to be a walk in the park.From there, they knew they were entering a familiar territory as the national finals were to be held at a venue they were now used to Glamis Stadium, probably with the equipment they had used last year giving them an advantage over newcomers from other provinces.From winning the provincial final, the young men dedicated most of their time to rehearsals as they were on a mission to take the top spot.But what did they change from last year?Tendai Gwazi said he believed the trick was their vocal ability and social message in the three songs they performed on Saturday. From last year, what we mainly changed was the message on our songs. All the songs we performed, people can relate to them because they tackle issues which affect their day to day living, said Gwazi. When one looks at my age, they re amazed that messages on issues such as marriage can come from me as they ll be expecting it to come from older people. Apart from that, their other trick was in taking notes from Macheso whom the group closely follows.For their efforts, the group was presented with a $7 000 cheque as well as a recording contract. On second position was Masvingo s Wood Pickers while RJ Zvavapachena from Bindura came third. Kupenya Stars from Bulawayo who had hoped to do the province proud were nowhere near the top.
