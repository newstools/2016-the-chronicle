Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE odds are heavily staked against Highlanders when they troop into Rufaro Stadium this afternoon for a Castle Lager Premiership clash against bogey side Harare City. Not only have Bosso failed to beat Harare City since their promotion into the topflight league in 2012, but they have not managed to score a single goal against the municipal side in the capital.Harare City have bullied Bosso at will at Rufaro Stadium in all but their first meeting that ended 0-0 on August 25, 2012.Highlanders were taken to the cleaners in the 2013 season with a 0-4 thumping. Bosso were under then assistant coach Bekithemba Ndlovu after former head coach Kelvin Kaindu had flown to the United Kingdom for a coaching course.In 2014 and last season, Highlanders suffered identical 0-1 losses. So all odds will be heavily stacked against the visitors this afternoon, but coach Erol Akbay warned people not to rely on the past. We need to end that barren streak. If we have not been scoring, then we must do that. As a coach, I don t like 0-0 scores, so we just have to score and not only that, but get maximum points. We need maximum points in all our remaining seven games, said Akbay.He said their preparations went well and his boys have the zeal to win. All our games now are treated as cup finals and during our training sessions one could see that in the boys, said Akbay.Moses Chunga s Harare City will be without the suspended duo of key players Martin Vengesayi and Edwin Madhananga after they accumulated three yellow cards each.However, they still have the menacing Ronald Chitiyo and William Manondo in their ranks.Highlanders are likely to throw in the same line-up that has garnered maximum points in their previous two games.Defence rock and Soccer Star of the Year contender Peter Muduhwa will marshal the rearguard that also consists of Tendai Ndlovu, Honest Moyo and Tendai Ngulube.They ll have to keep an eagle s eye on the slippery Chitiyo, especially when either Ngulube or Moyo overlap, as Chunga might want to use the wings as attacking avenues.Harare City defensive kingpin Themba Ndlovu will have to be at his best to shut out Bosso s twin strikeforce of Nhlanhla Ndlovu and Prince Dube.Dube might have last scored months back, but he has been key to the Highlanders attacking prowess and his partnership with Nhlanhla has been a joy to watch lately.@skhumoyo2000
