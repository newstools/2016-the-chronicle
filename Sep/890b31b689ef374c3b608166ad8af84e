The 82-year-old said he suffers from epilepsy and could no longer perform, especially considering his advanced age. I ve called it quits on the music industry. I made the decision in June when I realised that my health was deteriorating and I wasn t getting any younger. I get fits because of epilepsy which I ve suffered from since I was in my 20s. For the sake of my health I ve quit, said SitholeThe soft spoken crooner who now uses crutches said he had since moved in with one of his children because of his ailing health. I lived in Sotshangane Flats in Makokoba for most of my life. However, because of the flight of stairs there, it s become difficult for me to go up and down. My children found it best I move in with them so I now stay in Sauerstown and I m enjoying it there as I m being taken care of well.

Imagine a person of my age wakes up at 5AM so that I can get to the main Post Office bank to join the queue, he said.He appealed to the relevant authorities to find lasting solutions to the plight of the elderly. Someone in Government should see our plight as the elderly and make our lives easier. Surely we can t at our age be queueing for long periods, he said.
