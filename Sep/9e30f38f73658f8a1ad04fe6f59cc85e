Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent SCORES of youngsters were on Saturday afternoon treated to a fun filled day out at the Commissioner General s Fun Fair at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair show grounds in Bulawayo.

Toddlers rode police horses with their parents while police officers guided the friendly horses around the show grounds.There were long queues at the motorbike and quad bikes section throughout the day as children waited patiently for their turn.When the children were finally driven around, the excitement on their faces could not be hidden.As this was happening, their amused parents snapped pictures with their cell phones to capture the moment.Among those having fun at the fair were Melody Sibanda and her daughter Pauline from Iminyela suburb, who said her eight year old daughter enjoyed the day. I thought it would be a good idea to bring my daughter here and enjoy the day with the police. She was particularly captivated by riding the quad bike, she wanted to go on it over and over again, said Sibanda.A couple, the Murewas, from Sauerstown suburb said they were invited by their friends who were in the police force and they decided to bring their children, Alexander (7) and Paul (5). This was a wonderful day out with the family. But in particular the children enjoyed the day. I hope such an event can come back to Bulawayo next year and they should hold it during school holidays, said Timothy.As has become the norm with most family events, children love to get their faces painted and they got their hearts desire as different shapes and colours dotted their faces during the fair.Throughout the day, Pastor Charles and Amai Charamba, Jeys Marabini, Sandra Ndebele, Clement Magwaza, Sniper and the ZRP Band kept the hundreds of revellers on their feet with entertainment.
