Godwin Simbarashe MhakaLovemore Zigara in GweruREIGNING Mr Zimbabwe fitness physique and two time Mr Ironman physique champion, Godwin Simbarashe Mhaka has qualified to compete at the International Federation for BodyBuilding (IFBB) Diamond Cup in United Kingdom slated for October. The qualification comes hard on the heels of his triumph in South Africa where he won the IFBB Boksburg Classic men s physique overall title on August 6 before triumphing at the Mr and Ms Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness Championships and Ironman 2016 (formerly Mr and Ms Ironman Zimbabwe) held last weekend.He looks set to follow in the footsteps of Gweru born bodybuilder Victor Hungwe who rose to fame in South Africa before taking part at the Mr World finals in Naples, Italy.Mhaka said he is relishing the opportunity which he wants to use as a pedestal to turn professional. This is a dream come true for me and it fits well in my plans of turning professional, he said. I have observed that in the sport industry one has to work very hard. I was a track and field athlete before where I learnt a lot of lessons. I would like to thank the Federation (of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding National and Fitness) for its efforts to bring more genres in the physique industry because it is allowing people with different genetic make-ups to find career paths, he added.Should Mhaka win his division he will earn an IFBB elite card to allow him to participate at the IFBB Elite World Cup which will be a gateway to obtain IFBB pro card which he attains through an application from IFBB Zimbabwe.However, the hulk can easily earn a pro card by winning the overalls at the Diamond Cup.Mhaka who last year won the Pretoria Classic Male Aerobic Fitness Championships in South Africa features in the latest issue of Muscle Evolution, a South African health and fitness magazine.Meanwhile, Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding National and Fitness spokesperson Quiet Shingai said the organisation has already sent Mhaka s application to IFBB which has since been processed.
