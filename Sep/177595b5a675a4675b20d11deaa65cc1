Tapuwa KapiniSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ECCENTRIC former Highlanders and Warriors shot stopper Tapuwa Kapini put up a top drawer performance that saw him save two penalty kicks inside 90 minutes as his Highlands side made a winning debut in the Absa Premiership on Tuesday. The inspirational Kapini made his first save when he denied fellow Zimbabwean Marshal Munetsi, on loan from Orlando Pirates and now playing for Baroka United, before denying their skipper Olaleng Shaku as Highlands cruised to a 2-1 win through goals from Zambian Collins Mbesuma and another Zimbabwean Charlton Mashumba. Munetsi had shot Baroka into the lead through a first half penalty.On a night in which Zimbabweans were on song, former Chicken Inn forward Tendai Ndoro continued with his rich vein of form as he scored two goals inside a minute to propel Orlando Pirates to a deserved 2-1 win over a stunned Ajax Cape Town. Ndoro took his goal tally to five in two matches, a mockery of the Zimbabwean situation where some strikers have scored an equal number of goals in 23 matches.But it is the man-of-the-match performance by the former Highlanders goalkeeper Kapini that has silenced his critics especially after he publicly condemned the selection criteria used for the Warriors with some claiming that he was jealous and past his sale by date.Kapini questioned the continued snubbing of FC Platinum goalkeeper Petros Mhari, one of the most outstanding goalkeepers in the country in the last three years and accused player intermediary Gibson Mahachi of having an influence in the selection process since Warriors coach Callisto Pasuwa was also under his stable.@skhumoyo2000.
