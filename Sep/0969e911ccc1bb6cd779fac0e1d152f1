Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BANTU Rovers striker Fortune Nkomazana is the first player to bag the monthly Nokel Security Zifa Southern Region Division One League Top Goal Scorer accolade this season. Nkomazana, joint winner of the Nokel Security Zifa Southern Region Division One League May Top Goal Scorer accolade with ex-Amagagasi forward Nhlanhla Ndlovu, will be presented with his July winnings during his team s next home game.According to Zifa Southern Region administrator Augustine Ndlovu, Nkomazana scored four goals to beat teammate Joshua Wilson, who scored three goals in July.There were four players, Bulawayo Chiefs duo of Pride Zireni and Joseph Mutambiranwa as well as Technosphere pair of Bekithemba Nyoni and Herbert Sibanda, who scored two goals each. Nkomazana of Bantu Rovers, who shared the May award with former Amagagasi striker Nhlanhla Ndlovu, is the winner of the Nokel Security Zifa Southern Region Division One League July s Top Goal Scorer. He will get his award during his team s next league game, said Ndlovu.The league is likely to combine the August and September award because of the mid-season break last month.Ndlovu said they are bracing for more goals in the second half of the campaign, with strikers chasing the end of season $200 bonus should they hit the 22-goal mark.Kenneth Mhlophe, Nokel Security director, said his company would add a $200 bonus to the $150 prize money should a player surpass the 22-goal mark. We hope the award will motivate strikers to work harder and surpass the 10 goals that were scored last year by former Bulawayo Chiefs striker Ishmael Wadi. On top of the $150 that we award to the overall top goal scorer at the end of the year, the player who scores 22 goals or more will walk away with an extra $200. The reason we ve set a bonus for the 22-goal mark is that even in the Premiership goals run out in the second half and it is goals that make football exciting, Mhlophe said.Wadi, an attacking midfielder, now turns out for FC Platinum and has been a regular for the PSL championship favourites.In 2014, the Southern Region top goal scorer was former Tsholotsho FC forward Edmore Chirambadare with 14 goals. Chirambadare s goal poaching prowess saw him land at Chicken Inn where he helped them win the 2015 PSL championship before he was snapped up by South African giants Kaizer Chiefs.Tashinga Mungadze of Black Boots is presently leading the Southern Region League s scorers chart with 10 goals from 17 games and can surpass the 22-goal mark should he maintain his form and barring injuries.Nhlanhla Ndlovu has since joined Highlanders, having scored eight goals by the time he left the second tier league.Other players that might fancy their chances of winning the accolade include Nkomazana, Rovers striker and captain Bukhosi Sibanda on seven goals, as well as Lungile Nyathi of Amagagasi and Carlos Dube from Victoria Falls Tigers, both tied on six goals.
