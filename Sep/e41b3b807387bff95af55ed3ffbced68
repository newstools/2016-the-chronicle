Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter REGIONAL automotive spare parts retailer, Motovac Group, which opened its doors for business in Bulawayo yesterday, plans to open another branch in Harare by September next year. The new business is co-owned by Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko s family and the Botswana-based Patel family.The Mphoko family is a key shareholder in a regional supermarket chain, Choppies Enterprises, which has about 30 branches across the country. Partner and Choppies Zimbabwe director, Mr Siqokoqela Mphoko, said: The automotive spares parts business is part of our efforts in the fight against poverty. We ve opened this business as part of poverty eradication through creation of employment as well as empowerment. We re also looking forward to spreading our wings by opening a similar branch in Harare by this time next year. The opening of Motovac s first branch in the country has created 20 jobs with 90 percent of the recruited people being women.Mr Mphoko said employing a majority of women, whom they have trained, was meant to promote gender equality by giving women equal opportunities as their male counterparts on the job market. Our vision is to spread our wings across the country but the extent to which we expand is dependent on the support that we get from our clientele in the motor industry, he said.Motovac offers a wide range of products including suspension parts, engine parts, bearings, batteries, ball joints and brake pads. As we re showing our commitment to investing in the country, as business we appeal to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority to take its part in the ease of doing business. We don t want a situation whereby our trucks that would be loaded with spare parts will have to stay at the border for days awaiting clearance into the country, he said.Motovac has 12 branches in Namibia, 18 in Botswana and two in Mozambique.@okazunga
