Kinshasa Political talks between the government and opposition parties have reportedly been suspended after the main opposition block, Rassemblement, set pre-conditions for attending. According to Voice of America, the Rassemblement s demands included freeing political prisoners, lifting existing bans on several TV stations and the resignation of the dialogue s current facilitator, Edem Kodjo, former chairperson of the Organisation of African Unity.A previous News24 report indicated that tensions in the DRC arose following a controversial court ruling that allowed President Joseph Kabila to remain in power beyond the two consecutive presidential terms permitted by the country s constitution.Last month the main opposition alliance called for a general strike against Kabila s 15-year rule. This was after rejecting talks over elections that were due to be held in November.The elections were suspended until next year after government authorities said that a delay would be needed to register millions of new voters.Kabila came into power after the assassination of his father in 2001 and although the constitution stated that a president could only serve for two terms, there have been consistent delays as Kabila clings onto power.US President Barack Obama recently urged Kabila to hold a credible poll that respected the DRC s constitution.Obama noted that Kabila s legacy as a leader who brought his country out of war and set it on a path toward democratic progress would be bolstered by free and fair elections.
