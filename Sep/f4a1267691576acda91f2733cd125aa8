Ilkay Gundogan, Leroy Sane and Claudio Bravo will all be available to make their Manchester City debuts in the derby against United at Old Trafford on Saturday, a source has told ESPN FC. None of the three has featured for Pep Guardiola s side since joining in the summer, although Bravo only arrived from Barcelona four days before City played West Ham on August 28.Gundogan has been recovering from a dislocated kneecap, suffered while at Borussia Dortmund in May, which kept him out of the European Championship.However, the 21 million signing has been back in full training for over a fortnight while Sane, who joined from Schalke in August, is also available after overcoming a hamstring injury.Bravo, meanwhile, has taken over the No. 1 shirt from Joe Hart after the England keeper moved to Italian club Torino on a season-long loan.However, the Chile international has yet to train with the first team, according to The Sun, so Guardiola may stick with Willy Caballero, who has started all three of City s Premier League matches this season.Captain Vincent Kompany is pushing to be included against United after coming through a behind-closed doors training match last week.The Belgium international has not played since limping out of the Champions League semifinal defeat to Real Madrid in May with a thigh injury.But City are without striker Sergio Aguero, banned after being found guilty of elbowing defender Winston Reid in the win over West Ham.
