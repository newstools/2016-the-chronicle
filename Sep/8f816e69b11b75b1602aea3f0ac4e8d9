She thought he would return armed and kill her. After about two weeks, we realised that the pregnancy was no longer visible, prompting us to alert neighbourhood watch officers who questioned her, said the source.It was revealed that Arldonis admitted she had killed her baby.Arldonis had two other children before she married Mayibongwe and the couple has been married for four years now.They have one child together.Matabeleland North provincial acting police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Eglon Nkala confirmed the incident.
