Winner Simon Mpuyazi flanked by runners up, Alfred Jobe (l) and Lucky Mdenge (r),Beauty, they say, lies in the eyes of the beholder. Well, so does ugliness. At the Bit by Bit nightclub, history was made last Saturday as South Africa crowned its first Mr Ugly. The first of its kind in South Africa, the Mr Ugly pageant held in Mtubatuba, KwaZulu-Natal, was won by Simon Mpuyazi after a long evening.Nine entrants had competed for a grand prize of R1 000, while the runners-up Alfred Jobe and Lucky Mdenge walked away with R500.Club owner David Ntshangase a former judge said he decided to hold the pageant in order for those who feel that they are ugly, to leave the competition feeling that they too, are worthy of celebration and recognition. Ugly and fat people are among the most discriminated against people. You always get beautiful people competing and no one gives ugly people a chance to showcase themselves, said Ntshangase who claims that he is not handsome himself and can relate to the entrants. Every human was crafted with the same hand of creation. The nine entrants put through their paces in front of a large crowd and three judges, with one of the judges being personality Joe Mafela. The counterpart of the competition has long been held in Zimbabwe, where Mison Sere is the reigning king.This year s unique and highly-publicised Mr Ugly Zimbabwe will be held later this year in Harare. Mr Ugly Africa and Mr Ugly World have also been introduced with Mr Ugly Africa pencilled for Johannesburg, South Africa between November and December while Mr Ugly World will be held in Zimbabwe next year.
