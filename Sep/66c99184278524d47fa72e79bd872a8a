Sikhumbuzo Moyo Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Women s Football interim vice-chairperson Cecilia Gambe lived to fight another day after her hearing was postponed to a later date by the Zifa ad hoc disciplinary committee chaired by the association s vice-president Omega Sibanda. The Mutare-based veteran administrator was charged by Zifa for bringing the game of football and the association into disrepute after she stormed the Sakubva Stadium pitch during a Mutare City Rovers and How Mine Castle Lager Premier Soccer League clash on May 8.The controversial Gambe manhandled the referee and pointed a middle finger at the hapless official. Her actions cost Mutare City Rovers a $2 000 fine under the PSL s rules and regulations Order 31. We needed some documents which were not availed to us. We then postponed the matter to a later date which shall be announced soon, said Sibanda.It is believed the committee, made up of regional chairpersons and one legal brain, wanted the referee s, match commissioner and police reports.Gambe is not new to controversy following her shocking outburst ahead of the Zifa elections last year when she claimed the Sports and Recreation Commission had endorsed the then presidential candidate Philip Chiyangwa.This was after the property mogul had donated $10 000 to the Mighty Warriors as part of their preparations for the Rio Olympics. @skhumoyo2000
