Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter THE European Union (EU) has disbursed $1,6 million in the first half of 2016 against a $1 million target for the year in support of the smallholder livestock support programme. The initiative is part of Government s Livestock Policy, which is underpinned by robust development of the sub-sector. To this end, a total amount of $1.6 million has been disbursed towards these projects during the period January June 2016, against a projection of $1 million for the year, Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa said.In his mid-term fiscal policy statement last week, the minister also reported that the national herd has risen to 5.528 million up from 5.477 million in the 2014/15 period.Minister Chinamasa said the EU was supporting smallholder livestock through the rehabilitation of infrastructure that included 50 dip tanks, seven feedlots and 131 boreholes in Nkayi and Lupane districts, benefitting 40 000 households. In addition, the EU is also supporting the livestock value chain with the development of formalised markets as well as animal health and disease control, he said.Minister Chinamasa noted that despite the adverse effects of drought, livestock numbers across all categories have recovered with the exception of goats.He said livestock drought mitigation projects over access to feed, coupled with rehabilitation of water points have helped farmers.In July, Industry and Commerce Minister Mike Bimha said the Government would soon avail a $2,3 million facility sourced from the African Development Bank to support the beef and leather value chain in Matabeleland region.Towards the end of last year, AfDB promised availing funding for the support of Zimbabwe s beef and leather value chain technical assistance project.The overall objective of the technical assistance project is meant to catalyse the country s economic growth and contribute in addressing Zimbabwe s fragility through reviving the beef and leather industries.The project will include a platform for stakeholders aimed at enhancing dialogue at national level, among stakeholders (public and private) in the beef and leather value chain, for coordinated action.Another component of the project is the business environment streamlining and reform aimed at facilitating support for the Government in its initiative to review and streamline reforms to the existing beef and leather sub-sector policies and regulations taking into account the stakeholders concerns in the value chain.The project will also offer technical support for the design of a livestock information and traceability system as well as preparation of a proposal for dip tanks construction and rehabilitation, among others.Presently, Zimbabwe s leather industry is operating at a subdued capacity despite market opportunities in markets such as Sadc and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa as well as abroad.@okazunga
