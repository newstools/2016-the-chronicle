Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter PINT-sized and deadly Hwange hitman Gift Mbweti says his time to don the national team jersey will come and he doesn t want to put himself under unnecessary pressure to impress national team coaches. The friendly Victoria Falls-born predator, with eight goals to his credit this season in 18 matches at an average of a goal in two games, says he wants to concentrate on improving his game at his club. I am still trying to work on my game, improve where I am probably lacking and to be honest with you, I am not even thinking of the national team because that will put me under a lot of unnecessary pressure and attention, and once that happens, everything can just crumble in front of me, especially if I don t do well in the national team, said Mbweti.Mbweti (24) said he needs to fully mature as a player first before aspiring to play for the national team. A number of players sometimes overrate themselves and say things which are almost impossible to achieve. I am not one of those. Yes an opportunity can arise for me to go outside the country, but I must not put myself under undue pressure. At the moment I am a Hwange player and all my energies must be directed at helping my club, said Mbweti.Hwange legend and former coach David Phiri said Mbweti just needs to work on his physical attributes and the whole circle will be complete. He has all that a coach needs in a player, ball control, distribution, marking and dribbling; all he needs now is to work on his physical side and everything else will fall into place, said Phiri.Mbweti said he was targeting between five and six goals in the remaining eight games of the season. @skhumoyo2000
