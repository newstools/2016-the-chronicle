Highlanders secretary-general Emmet NdlovuSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter GATE charges for Sunday s encounter between traditional rivals Highlanders and Dynamos will remain the same as other games played at Barbourfields Stadium, a Bosso official has said. Highlanders secretary-general Emmet Ndlovu said the rest of the ground will pay $3, Wings $5 and VIP $10. We are not hiking the charges because we are taking it like any other game; no one is special. Our fans have been supporting us through thick and thin this season paying $3, so why should we punish them this time around, said Ndlovu.He said they wanted the match to be a beautiful family day where fans will come to enjoy football. Let people come and enjoy the beauty of this game, he said.The decision to keep gate charges unchanged is likely to result in a bumper crowd as both sets of supporters will surely come in their numbers.Due to Bosso s previous decisions to hike charges for arguably the biggest fixture in domestic football, attendance figures had been dwindling over the past few years, with the highest attendance in 10 years being 26 500 in 2006 when Highlanders recorded a 2-1 win that was to be the last league win Bosso recorded over their archrivals for 10 years.Thereafter, figures went down with 2007 recoding 20 790 fans, 2008 (19 580), 2009 (12 000), 2010 (15 000) and 2011 (16 000).Attendance rose significantly to 25 987 in 2012 under coach Kelvin Kaindu, as fans believed they would finally end Dynamos dominance over Bosso.Numbers have never gone above the 2012 attendance, but Sunday could break the record as the home team s supporters retain some shaky hope of completing an unlikely double over DeMbare, something that Bosso last achieved in the 2006 season.@skhumoyo2000.
