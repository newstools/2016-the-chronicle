Sandra NdebeleBongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent DANCER-cum-singer Sandra Ndebele is now selling her music online as part of efforts to generate income from her hard work. She said by availing music on online music stores like iTunes, she also hoped to curb piracy as a wider audience will be able to access her music effortlessly.For the first time in her career, all her singles dating back to her debut Mama and hits Into Yami, Malaika and Inzima Lendlela and seven albums are now available on iTunes. An album costs $5 while a single track costs $2. All along, I ve been dragging my feet, not realising that many artistes were making money from downloads of their music online. I m glad to have followed suit and hope to get something, said Ndebele. The only way to fight piracy is to flood your music online. At least, some people who download the music can pay for it and I ll be able to get money from my hard work in studio. Ndebele said over the years, fans in the diaspora had requested for her music and she had opted to send it to them through traditional routes. The only time people could get my music was when someone from England or USA or Canada would visit Zimbabwe and I d give them to take it abroad. My friends and fans overseas had been asking for my music and now I m happy that they can access it on iTunes upon release, said Ndebele.She said she hoped that availing her music online would open more doors for her. I hope this will open doors for me in international music circles to get bookings from people in the diaspora, said Ndebele.
