Apple Valley NurseryThandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter AN APPLE VALLEY Pre-school head and a teacher have been arraigned for allegedly causing the drowning in a swimming pool of one of the pre-scholars. Mr Thabiso Mathema, the owner, representing the Bulawayo school and the late Junior Ibanathi Mpofu s teacher Ms Enert Phiri appeared before regional magistrate Mr Joseph Mabeza facing culpable homicide charges.The boy allegedly left the classroom to go to the toilet and the school caretaker later found his body floating in the school s swimming pool.In their defence outline presented by their lawyer Miss Busisiwe Dube from Ndove, Museta and Partners the two claimed they did not act negligently as alleged by the State. The two did not fail to safeguard the life of the deceased pupil and his death was not foreseen under the circumstances. They took all necessary steps and measures to ensure that all scholars are safe including the boy who drowned, said Miss Dube.She said her clients would lead evidence that the swimming pool area was at all times kept secure. The deceased was in the care of his teacher with other children and it was not reasonably foreseeable that the boy would sneak out and gain access to the swimming pool on his own. Mr Mabeza remanded the two out of custody to September 17 for commencement of trial.Prosecuting Mr Tinashe Dzipe alleges that on March 6 in 2013, the boy was under Ms Phiri s care at the pre-school which is in Bulawayo. According to the school programme, the children were set to do swimming lessons. However, they had to change the programme in preparation for sports competitions scheduled for the following Friday, said Mr Dzipe. @thamamoe
