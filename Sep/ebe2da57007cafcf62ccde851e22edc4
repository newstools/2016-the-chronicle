Prof Welshman NcubeNqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent MDC president Professor Welshman Ncube has ripped into the corrupt Bulawayo councillors calling them mafia gangs masquerading as residents representatives. Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister Saviour Kasukuwere last week suspended five councillors including the city s deputy mayor Gift Banda for alleged corruption. Others are Clrs Charles Moyo (Ward nine), Mzama Dube (Ward 25), Reuben Matengu (Ward 21) and James Sithole (Ward seven).All the 29 councillors in Bulawayo are from MDC-T.Only five councillors were found clean and the rest are set to appear before a tribunal to answer to corruption charges at a date to be announced.Prof Ncube, in an opinion piece, said the revelations of corruption in the City of Kings were nightmarish and infuriating. Reading the report on the goings on at City Hall, one cannot help but feel white hot rage. I kept having the sense that I am in a bad dream and will wake up to great relief. We cannot afford to have mafia gangs disguised as councillors doing irregular issuing of tenders, corrupt land deals, nepotism and looting of council property for personal gain, said Prof Ncube.He said it was unthinkable that councillors who were elected to promote residents interests have turned a blind a eye on their constitutional mandate and focused on looting.Although only five councillors were suspended the Government s audit revealed that most of the city fathers were involved in underhand dealings.The councillors who came out clean include the Mayor Clr Martin Moyo (Ward three), Clr Monica Lubimbi (Ward 29), Clr Concilia Mlalazi (Ward 18) and Clr Lot Siziba (Ward 13).Prof Ncube said the councillors were looting as if there was no tomorrow.He said it was incomprehensible that people elected on a democratic anti-corruption platform could do the things which are said to have been done. How is it possible that persons elected by some of these houseless residents could loot as if there was no tomorrow? he asked.Residents have hailed the suspension of councillors saying there is no smoke without fire.@nqotshili
