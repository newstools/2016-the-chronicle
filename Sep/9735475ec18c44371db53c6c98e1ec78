Tanaka Mrewa, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO man has been charged with attempted murder after he allegedly bashed his wife and three year old son with a log, leaving them hospitalised. A court heard that Never Mankuli (28) was drunk when he had an argument that was not disclosed in court with his wife Ms Luzivo Munsaka (23).Mankuli, the court heard, grabbed a log and hit his wife all over the body, before turning to his son and striking him three times on the head.He pleaded not guilty to an attempted murder charge.Mankuli admitted assaulting his wife but said he was unaware of the possible consequences of his actions. Your Worship I m so sorry I was not aware of the consequences. It s just that I was drunk and we had an argument with my wife. I had no intention to kill her, said Mankuli.Bulawayo Regional Magistrate Mrs Sibongile Msipa-Marondedze remanded Mankuli in custody to tomorrow.She dismissed his claim that he was not aware his action would lead to his family s hospitalisation. Surely you can t pick a log and hit someone severely with it then expect them not to die. If you were so drunk like you claim why didn t you just slap them? It s better for you to go and sleep over this matter. Read carefully the State papers and understand your charge. This is attempted murder that you are facing, said Mrs Msipa-Marondedze.Prosecuting, Miss Concilia Ncube told the court that on September 1 Mankuli came home drunk. He punched her all over the body then assaulted her with a log. Accused then turned to his son and struck him with the same log three times. Both complainants sustained severe injuries. His wife was injured on the scalp, chest and face, said Miss Ncube.She said both the child and mother were admitted at the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH).@tannytkay
