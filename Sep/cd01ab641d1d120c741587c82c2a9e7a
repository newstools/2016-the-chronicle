Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Highlanders technical team says a draw will not be an option when they take on arch rivals Dynamos in a blockbuster league match at Barbourfields Stadium tomorrow. The match has been code named Operation Double or Revenge . Highlanders are seeking to complete a double following their 2-0 win in the reverse fixture while DeMbare want to revenge.Speaking at a press conference at their club offices yesterday, the Bosso technical team also declared that they were now eyeing 24 points from the remaining eight league games and the count begins tomorrow with the DeMbare debacle. We cannot afford any mistakes now, we have 24 points to play for and we want those 24 points and the count begins with the Sunday game. The top teams are not winning as expected and therefore anything is possible at the end of the season, said head coach Erol Akbay.He said their title challenge, which is a deviation from the club s position of just a top four finish, will start against Dynamos, themselves still very much in the race, especially if they stop Bosso tomorrow.Veteran goalkeepers coach Cosmos Zulu called on the supporters who he said are the 12th player, to rally behind the boys and cheer them on until the last whistle. We need them to feel that they are really away, we need to intimidate them with the support because without our supporters we normally become an ordinary side, so let s not allow that to happen, said Zulu.He said he agreed with Akbay that the title was now very much within reach. It s a naked truth, we can win this thing (title). A draw for us on Sunday is not even an option, said Zulu.Bosso declared a clean bill of health with all the players available for selection except Benson Phiri.Probably line-upsHighlanders: Ariel Sibanda, Tendai Ngulube, Honest Moyo, Peter Muduhwa, Tendai Ndlovu, Erick Mudzingwa, Rahman Kutsanzira, King Nadolo, Allan Gahadzikwa, Prince Dube, Nhlanhla NdlovuDynamos: Tatenda Mukuruva, Dominic Mukandi, Ocean Mushure, Obey Mwerahari, Marshall Machazana, Stephen Alimenda, Masimba Mambare, Takudzwa Sadiki, Walter Mutasa , Denver Mukamba, Jacob Muzokomba&nbsp;
