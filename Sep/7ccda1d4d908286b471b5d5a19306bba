Prince Dube of Highlanders beats his markerSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Highlanders 2-1 Dynamos THREE minutes of magic saw Highlanders scoring two sweet headers to cancel a Dynamos one-goal lead thereby completing a rare double over their fiercest rivals in a pulsating Castle Lager Premier Soccer League encounter at a packed Barbourfields Stadium yesterday. Tendai Ndlovu and Ralph Matema both rose majestically to cancel DeMbare s first half lead and send the expectant Bosso fans into ecstasy that continued into the city centre after the match.Ndlovu headed home the equaliser in the 76th minute from a cross by stand-in skipper Erick Mudzingwa before Matema, who had come on for the ineffective Allen Gahadzikwa, connected a cross by outstanding central defender Peter Muduhwa beyond the reach of Dynamos goalkeeper Tatenda Mukuruva.Matema s goal came while Bosso fans were still celebrating the equaliser.With Highlanders seemingly in control of the game, their former midfielder Masimba Mambare stunned Barbourfields Stadium into deathly silence with a simple tap in off a Godknows Murwira header in the 28th minute.It was an underserved lead, which, however, exposed Highlanders defensive frailties, as they failed to deal with a harmless looking in-swinger from the right.The match had kicked off at a cracking pace with Dynamos calling the shots and Muduhwa made his first crucial intervention in the first minute to clip the ball off the legs of the overlapping Ocean Mushure.In the 10th minute, young strikers Nhlanhla Ndlovu and Prince Dube combined beautifully, but Ndlovu headed Dube s dipping volley wide off the mark.Three minutes later, Denver Mukamba broke loose from the centre circle and raced towards goal, with Honest Moyo chasing and let loose a scorcher from the edge of the box, which Bosso keeper Ariel Sibanda comfortably collected.A minute later, Dube beat three Dynamos defenders and took a crack at goal, which Mukura punched out for a corner kick.In the 17th minute, the Dube and Ndlovu combination was at work again and almost thrust Bosso into the lead.Highlanders supporters were ejected from their seats by Rahman Kutsanzira s fulminating drive from just outside the box that cannoned off the left upright post, with Mukuruva completely beaten.The home side continued to enjoy the lion s share of the proceedings, but failed to turn their dominance into goals, as Dynamos seemed content with just holding back.It was against the run of play that the Dynamos supporters found themselves celebrating when Mambare propelled the visitors into the lead in the 28th minute.The goal took some steam off Highlanders for a few minutes, probably still stung by the unexpected goal by their opponents.The second half had no major goalmouth action, as both coaches made substitutions in a bid to twist the game in their favour.Matema came on for Gahadzikwa in the 58th minute, while DeMbare coach Lloyd Mutasa pulled out his son Wisdom and brought in Tichaona Chipunza in the 66th minute.Bosso then came back into the game in the 76th minute through Tendai Ndlovu s powerful header. The stadium erupted and before they could take their seats, the second goal came in the 79th minute, sparking wild scenes of celebrations, particularly in the Soweto stand that was packed to capacity.The home side then took total control of proceedings and could have added a third had Matema been more composed in a face-to-face situation with Mukuruva in the 84th minute. He shot into the body of the Warriors goal minder when he could have rounded him up and tapped the ball into an empty net.Dynamos then camped in the Highlanders half searching for an equaliser. Bosso fans and players heaved a huge sigh of relief when referee Nduna Nkosana blew for full time. It s heartbreaking to lose to Highlanders. My boys lost concentration at a crucial time, said Dynamos coach Mutasa.His Highlanders counterpart Erol Akbay praised his players for a good show. We played good football, although a mistake cost us a goal. We needed this win to keep pressure on the leaders, Akbay said.PSL TABLE P W D L F A GD Pts FC Platinum 23 13 8 2 26 12 14 47 Caps United 23 13 7 3 30 15 15 46 Highlanders 23 12 5 6 30 17 13 41 ZPC Kariba 23 9 9 5 20 16 4 36 Dynamos 23 9 8 6 18 15 3 35 Harare City 23 9 5 9 25 20 5 32 Chicken Inn 23 8 7 8 21 16 5 31 Bulawayo City 23 8 7 8 19 19 0 31 Chapungu 23 7 9 7 21 19 2 30 Triangle United 23 8 6 9 21 26 -5 30 Ngezi Platinum 23 8 6 9 19 22 -3 30 How Mine 23 6 10 7 20 20 0 28 Hwange 23 7 7 9 19 25 -6 28 *Mutare City 23 6 5 12 19 35 -16 20 Tsholotsho FC 23 5 4 14 17 26 -9 19 Border Strikers 23 4 1 18 9 31 -22 13 *Three points deducted for use of a suspended player. @skhumoyo2000&nbsp;&nbsp;
