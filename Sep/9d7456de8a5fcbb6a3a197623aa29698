The R3.75 million crib which TV darling, Boity Thulo, boasted of on social media four months ago appears to be back on the market. In May this year, Thulo posted pictures of herself at her new pad holding a sold sign. This was followed by the message: Never in my wildest most far-fetched dreams did I ever think that God would do more for me than what I prayed for. I m constantly left gobsmacked at how God continues to show off His love through my life. This wasn t a part of the plan, but here I am able to gift myself with a house at the age of 26. I m in complete awe. To God be the glory. City Press has since learnt that the property is listed on privateproperty.co.za. The house in Midstream Ridge Estate in Centurion is currently occupied.A deed search did not reflect any property registered in the name of the TV actress. City Press also contacted the estate agent who had sold the house to Thulo. Amanda Fair from Dormehl Property Group confirmed that she knew who Thulo was, but declined to confirm whether the house was on the market.Attempts to call and SMS Thulo were fruitless as she did not pick.While Thulo s fans were happy for her at the time she posted on Instagram about buying the house, some wondered how she would afford a monthly bond of between R35 000 and R40 000. Some even speculated that a blesser was footing the bill.Ex-boyfriend Cassper Nyovest at the time denied that he was paying for the house. Thulo is the co-host of e.tv s music show, Club 808, and she also co-hosted the MTV show Ridiculousness Africa alongside Thomas Gumede and Nigerian comic Basketmouth. The Rockville actress recently joined SABC3 s High Rollers. DailySun
