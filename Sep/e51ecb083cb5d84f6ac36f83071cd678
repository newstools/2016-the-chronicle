Peter MuduhwaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS central defender Peter Muduhwa s stock continues to rise, with the skilful defender displaying a match winning performance that inspired Bosso to a sweet 2-1 victory over long time rivals Dynamos at Barbourfields Stadium yesterday. Muduhwa who turned 23 last month, reminds Bosso fans of former skipper Daisy Kapenya in just about everything, as he is good in the air and on one-on-one situations. He also embarrasses strikers and midfielders with his dribbling skills when going forward as demonstrated in yesterday s game when he rode a number of tackles before setting up Ralph Matema for the winning goal in the 76th minute.Muduhwa has established himself in the heart of the Bulawayo giants defence and partnered Tendai Ndlovu yesterday to thwart most Dynamos raids.The two gave Dynamos forwards Masimba Mambare and Denver Mukamba little room to manoeuvre, but it was Muduhwa, who stole the show with his skill and timely calm tackles.Muduhwa refused to be bullied by the seasoned Mukamba, a former Soccer Star of the Year, and even had the guts to dribble past the forward on numerous occasions.The former Ajax Hotspurs utility player in Zifa s Bulawayo Division Two Leagu is now a rock in the Bosso rearguard where he has never looked back since being given his breakthrough in Bosso s 2-0 win over Border Strikers in June. He has played 14 league matches for Highlanders this season.After yesterday s performance, Bosso coach Erol Akbay described Muduhwa as the best central defender in the country. If the national team coach wants a good defender, here is Peter. He is the best defender, said Akbay.Not only did he shut out Dynamos forwards yesterday, Muduhwa created Highlanders winning goal after going on a solo run from his half, dribbling his way through to cross for Matema to nod home.Muduhwa had earlier in the first minute of the match made a crucial intervention to thwart overlapping Dynamos left-back Ocean Mushure from shooting at goal inside the box. @ZililoR
