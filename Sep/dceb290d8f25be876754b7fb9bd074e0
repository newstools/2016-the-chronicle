Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter VICTORIA Falls Municipality has set aside close to $12 million to upgrade its water and sewer systems following complaints by residents about continued erratic services. The project will put an end to a septic tank system which residents have condemned.Briefing residents at a budget consultation meeting, outgoing Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube said the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project will start in March next year. The WASH programme will start soon and will run concurrently with BB7 and Buffer Zone housing projects. No planning was done for the water and sewer system in BD39 (Aerodrome) and we now want to normalise things, said Mr Dube.Council partnered CBZ in a $12 million deal for construction of BB7 and Buffer Zone houses.Town Treasurer Mr Thembinkosi Khumalo said the WASH project would be rolled out in two phases spread over two years. The council has spent $85 384 on layout plans for the project. The feasibility study has told us that the first phase of the project will cost $6,6 million and is expected to commence in March 2017 and will take 18 months, said Mr Khumalo.He said the second phase would cost $5,2 million.The Town Treasurer appealed to ratepayers to honour their obligations so that council can deliver.Council is owed $15 536 695 by residents and businesses while it owes service providers over $8 million.Contributing at the ongoing budget meetings, residents expressed fears that the water and sewer situation would worsen after completion of the new housing projects as the population would grow. The council must look into the issue of septic tanks which are now producing a strong unbearable stench at our houses, said Mr Blessing Munyenyiwa, a resident. @ncubeleon
