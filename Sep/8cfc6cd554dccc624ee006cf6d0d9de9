Tanaka Mrewa, Court reporter A 16-YEAR-OLD boy from Madlambudzi in Plumtree raped his five-year-old cousin four times after drinking a traditional concoction to boost his sex drive. The teenager who cannot be named for ethical reasons pleaded guilty to all counts.I was given isgubhu (aphrodisiac) by my friends and I drank a few sips. Im sure the stuff I drank led me to commit the offense. he said.Prosecuting, Mr Tinashe Dzipe told the court that there would be need to look into previous convictions as the boy was not sentenced for his other crimes.The boys father who shared the dock with his son told the court that his son had previous convictions for rape and stock theft. Yes my son was arrested for rape but the complainants mother refused to come to court so he was released. He was later arrested for stealing donkeys, said the father.Bulawayo regional magistrate Mr Joseph Mabeza remanded the teen out of custody to today for sentencing.State allegations are that the victims father found the boy in his daughters blankets.Accused used to go to the complainants homestead when her parents were away in the fields. He would take advantage and rape the victim and threaten to assault her if she told anyone about the ordeal, said Mr Dzipe. @tannytkay
