Edgar LunguLusaka The Zambian government has confirmed the date for the inauguration of President Edgar Lungu after the Constitutional Court dismissed an application by the opposition challenging his re-election, The Post reports. An independent election monitoring body tweeted the government s announcement yesterday.The inauguration ceremony has been set for Tuesday, September 13 at the National Heroes Stadium.Zambia s constitutional court yesterday threw out an attempt by the defeated presidential candidate, Hakainde Hichilema, to annul August election results, clearing the way for Lungu s inauguration.Hichilema, who lost the election by 100 000 votes, claimed that the result was rigged and launched a legal bid to stop Lungu retaining power.Lungu took office only last year when he beat Hichilema in a snap election.Zambia is known for its relative stability, but the run-up to the vote was marked by clashes between supporters of Lungu s Patriotic Front (PF) and Hichilema s United Party for Natiuonal Development (UPND).
