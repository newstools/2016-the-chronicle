Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter FORMER Zimbabwe 400m record holder Arnold Payne yesterday visited his former school Milton High where he held a motivational talk for pupils and staff members. Payne delivered two main topics importance of education in sports and change of lifestyle which aim to motivate pupils by changing their perspective when facing difficulties and helping them to have a goal in life.While addressing pupils, Payne talked about the importance of hard work and dedication needed for a successful life. He also suggested they keep an open mind to advice and taking responsibility of their actions. I just wanted to share with the guys the experience that I had as a Milton student and how my choices shaped me to the man that I am today. We have opportunities for scholarships for pupils that excel not only in the track and field but also in academics. You may be a record holder but you still need to meet the academic requirements to qualify for the scholarship. For those athletes who think that academics should come number two, they are mistaken, said Payne.Milton High school Deputy Headmaster Malusi Mazibuko expressed gratitude to Payne. He s got his business to run but he took his time to talk to the boys because he wants them to be successful as he is. Some people when they are at the top don t want anyone challenging their position but Payne wants the boys to excel in life and even do better than him. I hope today s talk will make a difference in the boys lives, Mazibuko said.@khumzallen
