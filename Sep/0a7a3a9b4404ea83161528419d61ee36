Bongani Ndlovu Showbiz Correspondent SUNGURA Masters dance group member Dumisani Ndlovu was left for dead last week after being robbed and beaten up by thieves in Bulawayo. The dancer was on his way home from Mathonisa Beer garden when the thieves pounced at about 11PM last Thursday. Chronicling his ordeal, Ndlovu affectionately known as Dumara, said all he remembered was waking up in hospital after being hit by a brick. I was walking home (Old Magwegwe) at about 11PM from Mathonisa Bar after a usual night out with friends. After crossing the traffic lights at Emancwabeni, I was hit by a brick on the head. I can t remember what happened afterwards. I only woke up in hospital swollen the next day. My two phones and wallet which had $28 had been stolen and I was in so much pain, said Ndlovu who is still admitted to Mpilo hospital.Ndlovu said it was fortunate that the incident happened close to his home as his brother immediately came to his rescue. I think people heard me scream for help so my brother rushed to assist me and organised that I be taken to hospital. Fellow group member Masotsha Ndlovu said he hoped the police would bring the culprits to book. Dumara is an integral part of the group and he was beaten up badly. I was told at 3AM on Friday and went to visit him in hospital. At least he s recovering well, said Masotsha. I hope the police find the people who committed the crime and bring them to book.
