Noel Munzabwa in Swaziland PROMOTION winning Zimbabwe born Tambuti FC coach, Tarisai Chingara has abruptly quit the club just three days shy of the MTN Premier League of Swaziland weekend kick off. The former ZRP Tomlison player dropped the bombshell yesterday morning claiming he was not ready to work under newly appointed head coach Alou Badara who the club unveiled last Thursday. I have developed this team, won promotion to the Premier League of Swaziland including preparing the team for the forthcoming season then someone out of the blue is brought in as my head coach, it s just unfair. If that is the way the club has decided to thank me then the best option for me is to quit and look elsewhere while my CV is still attractive than to work under someone who is yet to win something to his name. I have tendered my resignation though I was yet to sign any new contract with the club since they have been playing delaying tactics since July when they first stated I would sign the new contract in August, said Chingara.Quizzed on his next move, the coach who led the newcomers on a giant killing mission in this country s lucrative knock out tournament, SwaziBank Cup, down played recent media reports linking him with a role at Manzini Wanderers.Tambuti FC were due to open their maiden premiership life with an away date against Red Lions but there are growing indications that the WeekTwo fixtures could kick start the league due to the unavailability of Somhlolo National Stadium to host the big Mbabane derby which was the Week One pick of the nest.This might see Tambuti FC play host to Midas City.Chingara s resignation leaves the number of Zimbabwe born coaches in this league at three with Hebert Maruwa at Green Mamba, Manzini Sundowns Godfrey Tamirepi and Manzini Wanderers technical director Julius Chakupewa with Warriors assistant coach Saul Chaminuka taking charge of Matsapha United in the National First Division.@NoelMunzabwa.
