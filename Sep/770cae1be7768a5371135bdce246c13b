John Terry has been ruled out of action for approximately 10 days by Chelsea with strained foot ligaments, meaning the defender will miss Friday s Premier League clash against Liverpool. Chelsea confirmed in a short statement that Terry, who picked up the injury in the final minutes of Sunday s 2-2 draw with Swansea City and left the Liberty Stadium on crutches, will be out of action for approximately 10 days.It means the Chelsea captain is definitely out of Liverpool s visit to Stamford Bridge as well as next Tuesday s EFL Cup third-round tie against Leicester City, and faces a fight to recover for the Blues trip to the Emirates Stadium to take on Arsenal on September 24.In Terry s absence, David Luiz is expected to make his first Chelsea appearance since finalising a shock return to Stamford Bridge after two years at Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day. The Brazilian, along with fellow new arrival Marcos Alonso, was an unused substitute against Swansea.Gary Cahill is expected to keep his place alongside Luiz after sources told ESPN FC that the England international will not be punished by the Football Association for his postmatch tweets and comments about referee Andre Marriner in the wake of the Swansea draw.Terry underwent immediate treatment from Chelsea s medical staff on the squad s return from south Wales on Sunday, but swelling around the 35-year-old s ankle delayed the scan that has now confirmed the extent of the injury.The 35-year-old signed a new one-year contract at Chelsea in May after a lengthy standoff that he claimed required him to accept a different role at Stamford Bridge, but started each of the Blues first four Premier League matches this season at the heart of Antonio Conte s defence.
