BATSWANA interested in exporting donkey meat now have the path cleared for their ventures as government is now issuing permits for the potentially lucrative business. Agriculture Minister, Patrick Ralotsia, implored Batswana to start rearing donkeys specifically for export as government keeps tabs on whether the businesses will be viable.The latest developments are sweet music to the ears of several Chinese investors who have expressed interest in partnering with Batswana to develop donkey meat production businesses in the country for export to their country.Exporting donkey meat to China is seen as another opportunity, which Botswana could tap into as the meat is considered a delicacy to Chinese people and is actually more expensive compared to beef.Other lucrative markets for donkey meat are Denmark, Germany and France.One investor is reportedly planning to aggressively tap into the 300 000-strong population of donkeys in Botswana. If this turns out to be a lucrative market, Batswana will also benefit a lot from it because donkeys have, to some people, been perceived as useless animals. The investors main customer will be Hong Kong, but they will also be exploring other markets elsewhere to maximise their profits, Ralotsia said.It is understood the main challenges in producing the export permits have been satisfying the South Africans on transit permits, particularly after authorities in that country strengthened the beef export and import regulations.Ralotsia, however, said the ministry was always in discussions with South Africans on their expectations and regulations.While donkey meat was in the past viewed with disdain by some sections of Botswana society, there are communities that have no qualms treating their taste buds to the meat.The beasts of burden will also be tapped into for their hides, as Ralotsia said permits had already been issued for Batswana interested in this part of the business.The latest developments follow a 2002 feasibility study conducted in Botswana on the possibility of exporting donkey meat to Europe.The then Minister of Agriculture, Johnny Swartz told Parliament that a team of private entrepreneurs conducted trial slaughter of donkeys and took samples for analysis abroad with the hope of supplying a section of the European market.
