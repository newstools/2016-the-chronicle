Luke MasomereTupeyo Muleya in Beitbridge PREMIERSHIP side Border Strikers have fired coach Never Malunga and his assistant Hilary Mukuruva and roped in veteran gaffer Luke Masomere as they try to stay in the top-flight league. Malunga becomes the second Border Strikers coach to be fired this year after they also parted ways with Saul Chaminuka.Club secretary, Rodlet Chigwinya, confirmed they had engaged Masomere who will be assisted by Stanford Ncube. We have decided to relieve Malunga and Mukuruva of their duties as we seek to revitalise our technical bench, said Chigwinya. We have replaced them with Luke Masomere and Stanford Ncube who will be in charge of our next game against Harare City at Rufaro Stadium in Harare on Friday.Chigwinya said they were worried with the way the team was losing points, especially in their away matches.Vavheneki has only managed four wins and one draw.Masomere said he was ready for the challenge. The team is sitting in a bad position and we need to play as a unit, from the executive, fans and the players, with one objective of avoiding relegation, said Masomere. The idea is not to expect wonders from the players or Masomere as a coach.I feel very challenged to be back on the technical bench and I am very hopeful that we will deliver if we all pull in one direction.
