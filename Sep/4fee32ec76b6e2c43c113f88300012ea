Callisto PasuwaSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA player intermediary Gibson Mahachi allegedly did not disclose in writing a possible conflict of interest in his dealings with Warriors coach Callisto Pasuwa. Efforts to get confirmation of disclosure drew a blank from Zifa communications manager Xolisani Gwesela, who failed to provide it for two days, but sources at the national association said such documentation was never submitted.Zifa can invoke Article Nine of the Fifa regulations that look at working with intermediaries. The world football governing body can also impose sanctions on him by invoking the same article.In not disclosing in writing that Pasuwa was under his management, which raises a possible conflict of interest as he has a number of players under his stable that have enjoyed a lot of game time in the national team, Mahachi breached Article Eight of the same regulations.Article Eight, Part One reads: Prior to engaging the services of an intermediary, players and/or clubs shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure that no conflicts of interest exist or are likely to exist either for the players and/or clubs or for the intermediaries. According the Part Two of the same article, no conflict of interest would be deemed to exist if the intermediary discloses in writing any actual or potential conflict of interest he might have with one of the other parties involved in the matter, in relation to a transaction, representation contract or shared interests, and if he obtains the express written consent of all the other parties involved prior to the start of the relevant negotiations.If sanctions are to be imposed on Mahachi, the association will then inform Fifa in terms of part two of Article Nine and the world body will then decide on the extension of the sanction to have a worldwide effect in accordance with the Fifa disciplinary code. Associations are obliged to publish accordingly and to inform Fifa of any disciplinary sanctions taken against any intermediary. The Fifa Disciplinary Committee will then decide on the extension of the sanction to have worldwide effect in accordance with the Fifa Disciplinary Code, reads Article Nine, Part Two of the rules and regulations on working with intermediaries.@skhumoyo2000
