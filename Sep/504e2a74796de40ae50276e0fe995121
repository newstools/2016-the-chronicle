Bianca Mlilo, Business Reporter GOVERNMENT departments should cut down on expenditure and channel more resources towards development projects that benefit ordinary people, Bulawayo residents said yesterday. Contributing during the 2017 national budget consultation meeting in the city, residents told the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Finance and Economic Development led by Cde David Chapfika that too much expenditure on salaries and allowances was frustrating development. We ask the Government to cut down on the travel expenses associated with its officials. The police force and army should also be trimmed and recruitment frozen, said Mr Welcome Moyo, a resident. It is not sustainable to be recruiting when other departments such as the education sector are understaffed. The residents said cutting expenditure would result in savings that will cater for procurement of drugs in hospitals and clinics and result in improved service delivery and incentivised social work.Another resident Mr Muziwandile Ncube said ministers and MP s allowances should also be reduced as well as the number of vehicles bought for them by the Government. I propose that the Government puts in place loan repayment audits and check how people are doing with these debts. These unpaid debts are also robbing us of much needed money, said Mr Ncube.Mr Alfred Ncube from the Centre for Public Relations said the Government could save more money by removing ghost workers from its payroll and laying off redundant staff. Over 90 percent of our national budget is gobbled up by wages and we have less than 10 percent of the budget spent on development. So Government would do well to lay off workers. We could then use these resources for the development of the country, he said.The 2017 budget, residents said, should promote accountability and facilitate growth as well as allow activities that would attract foreign direct investment.@BiancaMlilo
