Masca chairman Arthur Maphosa said development of cricket in Matabeleland South has lagged behind and the decision to hold the awards is meant to motivate aspiring cricketers to take up the sport seriously.Maphosa said they will honour individuals that took part in the Masca 40 overs clubs competition, which had three teams, Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Polytechnic, Gwanda Giants and ZRP Gwanda. Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Polytechnic won the league. These are our inaugural awards and our hope is to hold them every year. Establishing a league has been tough, but we managed to go through the season. What we ve been doing is making sure that cricket is played in schools before coming up with club cricket in every part of the province. Next season, which starts in a few weeks time, will have a team from Plumtree because most schools in that area are now playing the sport, said Maphosa.Masca will give awards for the best club, best batsman, best bowler, rookie of the year and players player of the year.There are also awards for schools cricketers for the best Under-13, Under-14, Under-16, Under-18 and Under-19.Cyrene s Adrian Sithole and Gwanda High School s duo of Tawanda Kamela and Elvin Khumalo will be presented with special awards for making it into the provincial team that took part in a Zimbabwe Cricket organised associate league.Maphosa said they would also honour umpires, scorers, coaches and teachers that were involved in the game at their event.@ZililoR.
