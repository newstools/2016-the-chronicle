Ntando van MoyoBongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent COMEDIANS and poets from around the world have come together to raise funds for pre-term babies through a poetry and comedy slam being held in Bulawayo. Pre-term birth, also known as premature birth, is the birth of a baby at less than 37 weeks gestational age. Zimbabwe is among the 10 countries with the highest yearly rate of preterm babies in the world at 16 percent according to the World Health Organisation.The show to be held on September 10 at Hope Centre in Bulawayo will be a partnership between Umahlekisa Comedy Club, Lol Entertainment, Rotary Club Matopos and the Baby Heroes Africa Foundation.Performers will include Amy from Harare, Leme from Tanzania and Blazing Sane from Bulawayo with comedians Umahlekisa director Ntando Van Moyo and Christian comedian Dumisani Maforty Ndlovu.Entrance to the event has been pegged at $3 for advance tickets and $5 at the door. People are also being encouraged to donate NAN formula 1, methylated spirit, cotton wool, Pampers small size and baby clothes to the cause.One of the organisers, Ntando Van Moyo, said: Our vision is to increase the chances of long term survival of children born prematurely while contributing to the ongoing improvement of maternal health in Africa. This is our small way of supporting the cause, said Van Moyo. Everyone has someone who they know, either a friend or relative who has had a preterm baby. It s very important for people to mobilise resources to help some mothers who can t afford to take care of their babies who re faced with such a problem. There re some babies who suffer from stunted growth and some who die because they lack basic care. All those who can come forward with donations are more than welcome. We re looking at raising $400 from the show, said Van Moyo.
