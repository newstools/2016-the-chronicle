Shalom AdonaiShowbiz Reporter GOSPEL acapella groups in Bulawayo are set to give music lovers a treat when they stage a Fill up the FOG concert. The show will be held at the Bulawayo Family of God (FOG) Church auditorium on September 24 and will feature prominent acapella groups such as Family Voices, Shalom Adonai, Power House, Orion and Touch.Entry on the day will be $5 for adults and $2 for children at the door.Hillary Moyo, director of Exhibit Events, organisers of the show, said they wanted to hold a show that would expose the groups to a 1 000 plus audience. The basic idea is to help local groups in Bulawayo to stage for an audience of 1 000 and more. The venue can hold that much people and we urge them to come and enjoy a night of melodious sounds that uplift the spirit, said Moyo.He said there was too much focus by local promoters on secular music, which has not drawn the desired crowds. Bulawayo has been focusing a lot on hip hop and house music without much success. So Fill Up the FOG is a way to show that there s an untapped market out there, which is gospel music. Individually the groups can attract sizeable crowds in various venues in the city, said Moyo.
