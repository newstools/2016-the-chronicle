Kuda Mahachi suffered a fractured wrist during a Warriors training session yesterday morning.Harare Bureau ZIMBABWE S Warriors suffered yet another blow to their preparations for their final African Cup of Nations Group L qualifier against Guinea with star winger Kuda Mahachi being ruled out of the trip to Conakry yesterday suffering a fractured wrist during their morning training. Mahachi has been one of the star performers, as Callisto Pasuwa s men marched into the 2017 Nations Cup in June with a game to spare.The 22-year-old Golden Arrows man came worse off an aerial tussle with Maritzburg United defender Blessing Moyo, with the former Chicken Inn ace landing awkwardly on his wrist during the senior team s workout at Gate Highway School.Pasuwa had initially named a 21-man squad that included three goalkeepers Tatenda Mukuruva, Donavan Bernard and Nelson Chadya but injuries and withdrawals have left the Warriors further depleted on the eve of their departure for the West African country.The Warriors have already had to make do without Mahachi s Golden Arrows new teammate Danny Phiri who was reportedly injured during ABSA Premiership debut game against Orlando Pirates.Bustling striker Nyasha Mushekwi is also out as he could not be released by his Chinese club.Only on Monday Pasuwa had to recall Ronald Chitiyo following injuries to FC Platinum speedy winger Marshal Mudehwe in a road accident last Sunday night.Warriors team manager Sharif Mussa, flanked by the team doctor Nicholas Munyonga explained the nature of Mahachi s injury.Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa also visited the Warriors shortly before their afternoon session at the National Sports Stadium. As you are aware, Kuda had a fall during the morning training session, it appeared nothing so serious but upon impact with his fall we thought it was better to check up on him because it looked like he had sustained a little bit of a fracture. It was proven he had fractured the bones on his arm of which he is now in plaster and we can do further checks with an orthopaedic surgeon here but he would like to go back to his club to get an orthopaedic opinion and if need be the treatment plan going forward. So he will not be part of our team travelling and we will remain at 17 players and we are not going to have any replacement for him at the moment, said Mussa.Munyonga added that early indications are that the winger might be ruled out for at least five weeks. The injury that he sustained obviously is a serious injury because he had a fracture of the radius and the anular bones on the right hand and it is an injury that needs to be operated on for him to recover early and fast. We expect him to be out a minimum of five weeks from the time when the operation has been done. So we have made a number of arrangements to allow him to be operated with two options either one he can be operated here or two he can be operated in South Africa because we have also been in touch with his club officials there and there are arrangements that probably the rehabilitation will be better if he is at his base in South Africa. So it is not a train smash it is only that he will miss a couple of weeks of playing football otherwise he will be back, said Munyonga.Coach Pasuwa said Mahachi s absence would be a big blow to the team as he wants to maintain continuity.
