Kim Jong-UnSeoul North Korea has executed a vice premier for showing disrespect during a meeting presided over by leader Kim Jong-Un, and banished two other officials for re-education, South Korea said yesterday. Since taking power after his father s death in late 2011, Kim is believed to have executed or demoted a number of senior figures in what analysts say is an attempt to tighten his grip on power. Vice premier for education Kim Yong-Jin was executed, Seoul s Unification Ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-Hee said at a regular briefing. Kim was killed by a firing squad in July as an anti-party, anti-revolutionary agitator, added an official at the ministry, who declined to be named. Kim Yong-Jin was denounced for his bad sitting posture when he was sitting below the rostrum during a session of North Korea s parliament, and then underwent an interrogation that revealed his other crimes, the official told reporters.The mass-selling JoongAng Ilbo first reported on Tuesday that top figures had been punished, but identified the education official by a different name. He incurred the wrath of Kim after he dozed off during a meeting presided over by Kim. He was arrested on site and intensively questioned by the state security ministry, it quoted a source as saying.The unification ministry said two other senior figures were forced to undergo re-education sessions.One of them was Kim Yong-Chol, a top official in charge of inter-Korean affairs and espionage activities against the South.The 71-year-old Kim is a career military intelligence official who is believed to be the mastermind behind the North s frequent cyberattacks against Seoul.Kim is also blamed by the South for the sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010 near the disputed sea border with the North in the Yellow Sea.Kim was banished to an agricultural farm in July for a month for his arrogance and abuse of power, the ministry official said.Kim Yong-Chol, who was subsequently reinstated this month, is likely to be tempted to prove his loyalty by committing provocative acts against the South, the official said. Therefore, we are keeping a close tab on the North , he said.South Korea s Yonhap news agency put the number of party officials executed during Kim Jong-Un s rule at over 100.The most notorious case was that of Kim s uncle and onetime No 2 Jang Song-Thaek, who was executed for charges including treason and corruption in December 2013.In April 2015, it was reported that Kim had his defence minister Hyon Yong-Chol summarily executed with an anti-aircraft gun.Reports of the latest execution coincide with a series of high-profile defections from the North.North Korea s deputy ambassador to Britain has defected to the South with his family, the unification ministry said earlier this month.
