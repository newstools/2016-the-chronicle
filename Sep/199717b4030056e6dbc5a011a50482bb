Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter LUPANE State University will today hold a fundraising golf tournament at the Elephants Hills Golf Course in Victoria Falls with more than 96 golfers expected to tee off. The tertiary institution hopes to raise a minimum of $60 000 which will go towards the construction of a clinic at the university s main campus in Lupane.Zwelithini Dlamini, the institution s marketing and public relations director said the idea of constructing a clinic came up after the realisation that the nearest health facility to the campus was overwhelmed by patients from the surroundings while the other was more than 30KM away. The golf tournament is for us to raise funds for the construction of a clinic within the university campus as we feel Lupane clinic and St Luke s Hospital could be overwhelmed with patients. While Lupane clinic is not very far from the campus, St Luke s is more than 30KM away hence we feel they might not adequately attend to the medical needs of the campus, said Dlamini.The tournament will use a Four Ball Better Ball format.In this format, golfers tee off in groups of four (either as one four-person team or as two, two-person teams), and each golfer plays his own ball. So there are four balls in play on each hole, but only one ball (the better ball, or low ball) counts per team per hole.If four-person teams are in use, then all four golfers tee off and play their own balls into the hole. The low score among the four counts as the team score for that hole. If two-person teams are in use, then Team One and Team Two tee off together (so four balls are still in play), and each team s low ball counts as that team s score on each hole. With two-person teams, 4BBB can be played as stroke play or match play.This is the second fundraising golf tournament that the university has held this year with the initial one held at Harry Allen Golf Club in Bulawayo in March.
