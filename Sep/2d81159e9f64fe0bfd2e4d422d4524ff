Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya, Showbiz Correspondent THE third edition of Jam sessions will be held at a new venue-Club 263 in Bulawayo- today as the live show is progressively drawing solid lines in the city s night life. Meant to promote local upcoming artistes, the Jam sessions were launched at Cecil Hotel hall, but had to be moved to a more central venue.The second edition of the show proved to be a milestone as the corporate world and budding artistes were part of it.This week the Jam sessions will be graced by 14 artistes who include rapper Guluva7, Babongile Skhonjwa, Soul Prince, Donna N, Hwabaraty, Delukes MKZ, Sir Palmer, Khuliyo, SOS Kadder Khoikhoi, Nyasha, Barry Nhlambex Changa, Sky Beezy and Mk. Entrance to the show will be pegged at $1 before 8PM and $2 thereafter.Coordinator of Jam Sessions, Nkululeko Nkala was upbeat yesterday. This is very promising as you can see our line-up gets interesting every time we hold the live show. This is the platform to buttress the point that indeed Bulawayo has talent, said Nkala. After noticing that Cecil Hotel was a bit far from city centre we decided to bring the show to Club 263 where everyone can easily access the show. We are positive that this time around we are going to hit the right note, as we promote local talent, he said.
