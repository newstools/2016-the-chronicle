Elizabeth Langa, interim chairperson for women s football leagueSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter CALLS by Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa for women football clubs to regularise their membership status with the association by August 31 went unheeded, with no club doing so by Wednesday. The regularisation process was meant to pave way for elections for a substantive leadership following a protracted wrangle since the unconstitutional ouster of Miriam Sibanda by the Cuthbert Dube led Zifa executive committee. Elizabeth Langa is the interim chairperson. Upon registration, each club will go through vetting in order to ensure appropriate and proper officials are in office during September 2016. In September, Zifa will publish registered clubs, followed by the announcement for Women Premier League and Division elections, both of which will require chairpersons who will be approved by congress and will be eligible for a seat on the Zifa Council. Elections to be held in Harare on October 22, 2016, at a venue to be advised, read the notice from Chiyangwa.Most clubs said they did not heed the call as they were not aware of it.Some regional leaders said they only got to learn about the call through the media.Clubs were supposed to contact acting Zifa chief executive officer Joseph Mamutse, who also confirmed that he was yet to get any correspondence from clubs. We never received a circular to that effect. We only read about in the media, said Southern Region Women s Football chairperson Takundwa Chimundiya.Women s football has not had a formal league for more than two years, with clubs choosing to organise themselves and play league matches officiated by retired referees.The Southern Region has been the most organised in that regard.The idea of a national league fell off the radar in 2014 after calls by clubs to have regional leagues as a way of cutting costs was turned down.@skhumoyo2000.
