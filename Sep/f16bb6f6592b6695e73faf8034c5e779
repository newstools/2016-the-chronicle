Walter Mswazie, Masvingo correspondent A DEATH row convict who last month threw a chair at a prosecutor while uttering obscenities at Chiredzi regional court, has been sentenced to another 60 years for housebreaking and robbery. Clemence Munyanyi (38) of Ingwani village in Sengwe communal lands is awaiting the hangman s noose after he was found guilty of shooting and killing Regis Dongonda who was in his vehicle outside Chishamiso Beerhall in Chiredzi in 2009.Justice Samuel Kudya sentenced Munyanyi to death for murder with actual intent in 2012.He was jointly charged with Sibusiso Dube (31) of Nketa 6 in Bulawayo who was, however, acquitted due to lack of incriminating evidence.Justice Kudya also slapped Munyanyi with a 14-year-jail term for shooting and seriously injuring Dongonda s workmate Ms Rudo Mavimbo.Munyanyi was back in court last month facing further charges.He sent Chiredzi regional magistrate Mrs Judith Zuyu scurrying for cover as he threw chairs while shouting obscenities in protest against being put on trial.Munyanyi pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of armed robbery, unlawful entry and theft, attempted murder, possession of fire arms before Mrs Zuyu on Wednesday, but was convicted due to overwhelming evidence.Mrs Zuyu slapped him with a combined jail term of 70 years. She however, suspended 10 years for five years on condition of good behaviour.Passing sentence, Mrs Zuyu said Munyanyi, who together with accomplices that are still on the run, instilled fear in their victims through shooting them, deserved a deterrent sentence. The accused unleashed a reign of terror in and around Masvingo province robbing people. He sometimes hid his loot in Mozambique. You did not show remorse during trial when you threw a chair at the prosecutor and hurled insults. You deserve a very deterrent sentence which may assist in your reformation provided you will survive the vagaries of prison life, said Mrs Zuyu.For the State, Ms Moreblessing Rusere said between 2008 and 2009, Munyanyi with his accomplices went on an armed robbery spree.She said the gang committed offences that included attempted murder, possession of fire arms and unlawful entry and theft in Masvingo province. Between 2008 and June 18, 2009, Munyanyi robbed people of their vehicles and sold them in Mozambique. Together with his accomplices who are still at large, Munyanyi robbed Chiredzi Town Council of a number of vehicles. He shot and injured some of his victims with a Norinco 9 mm pistol, said Ms Rusere.The court heard that Munyanyi s honeymoon ended in 2009 when he shot dead Dongonda and injured the deceased s female workmate at a beer hall in Hippo Valley, Chiredzi.She said Munyanyi was arrested and sentenced to death after which further investigations implicated him in 12 more counts of robbery, unlawful entry and theft, illegal possession of fire arms, attempted murder and armed robbery.@walterbmswazie2
