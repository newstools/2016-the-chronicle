Richard Muponde, Gwanda Correspondent LIVESTOCK farmers in Matabeleland South have clinched a deal to export beef, goat meat and mutton into the regional and international market. The breakthrough has been brokered by Zim-Trade, the country s trade agency, in liaison with the Matabeleland South Provincial Chamber of Small to Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs).This will be the first in more than a decade since the country last exported beef.Speaking during the preparatory meeting of Matobo Business Expo, provincial SMEs chairperson, Mr Danny Nyathi, said all the paper work was being processed to commence exports. As an association we approached ZimTrade to assist our members with market linkages. This was after the realisation that we have products that we could not sell while they were still attractive and valuable, he told Business Chronicle. We now have got the opportunity to export beef, goat meat and mutton to any country on the continent. So far Angola has proved to be our number one buyer with best buying prices. Previous records show that they were buying a kilogramme of beef at $18 while goat meat was fetching $20 per kg inclusive of all costs. Mr Nyathi said demand for mutton and goat meat was also high in Malaysia and Dubai as these countries do not eat beef.Asked about the logistics of getting the product to its final destination, he said they would be using Cold Storage Company facilities and their import and export licence. We engaged an experienced company in beef handling, the Cold Storage Company. Farmers must be fully aware that it is not CSC which is exporting but communal farmers themselves. The refrigerated container carries 200 beasts per trip. Once we avail many animals, the more the trips will become and the more money we will get as farmers, said Nyathi. CSC has agreed to charge us $55 per beast for the services of slaughter, storage, chilling and packaging, he said.
