South African rapper Cassper Nyovest has responded to the storm surrounding his Fill Up Orlando Stadium merchandise, saying that he will not change until he has achieved his goal of filling up the iconic venue. Cassper had social media in frenzy recently when he posted a picture of himself wearing some of the merchandise from his upcoming show at Orlando stadium, with the word stadium spelt incorrectly.But it seems the rapper is unfazed by the hundreds of comments he s been receiving from people mocking and pointing out the error.Not only has he continued to post pictures of himself wearing T-shirts with the error on it but he has told fans that he will continue to do so.Taking to Twitter on Tuesday, Cassper responded to a fan, asking him what he would do now that his merchandise contained the error, with a cheeky response. I m gonna wear them until 40 000 tickets are sold. He later went on to question whether the event would have got so much of its recent exposure if the T-shirts did not contain the error. Anything to destroy Nyovest huh ?? Thanx for the Promo, he added. -Times Live
