Minister Patrick ChinamasaLeonard Ncube in Victoria Falls THE Public Procurement Bill is ready for gazetting, setting the stage for the establishment of a procurement regulatory authority that will supervise and bring transparency in tender processes. &nbsp;Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa told procurement experts at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) summer school here on Wednesday that the Bill would address historic loopholes and ensure fairness, honesty, cost effectiveness and industry competition. Consistent with section 315 of the Constitution, which requires that the procurement systems be transparent, fair, honest, cost effective and competitive, the Public Procurement Bill is now ready for gazetting, said Minister Chinamasa.He said the Bill will transfer the responsibility of awarding tenders to procuring individual entities, with the State Procurement Board assuming a regulatory role. The competitive bidding method of procurement will be the normal method to be employed by procuring entities unless circumstances demand that the other methods be employed. The Bill will repeal the Procurement Act and abolish the State Procurement Board. In place of the Board, it will set up a new body to be called the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe, which will not conduct procurement services itself but instead will oversee and regulate procurement activities conducted by Government, parastatals and local authorities, said Minister Chinamasa who was guest of honour at the conference.The Bill also outlines procedures and steps to be followed in the process, as well as issue directives to procuring entities and report annually to Parliament.The minister said a well-managed procurement process is a good tonic to socio-economic development in the country as it can help generate revenue for Treasury as well as grow the economy.He urged the procurement entities to support domestic industry by partnering Government in implementing some of its policies such as Buy Zimbabwe, Ease and Cost of Doing Business and Statutory Instrument 64 of 2016.The two day conference ended yesterday. It was held under the theme Driving value for money in procurement. It drew participants from across the country s procuring entities and presenters from across the region.CIPS is there to enlighten businesses on procurement and supply as it offers a range of products and services to equip individuals or organisations with the knowledge, training and practical skills needed to derive maximum benefit from procurement practices.The institute has a global membership of 103 000 in 150 countries, with Zimbabwe currently having 960 members chaired by Mr Michael Musanzikwa. @ncubeleon
