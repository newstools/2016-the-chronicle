Cynthia Dube, Court Reporter A POLICE officer is seeking $150 maintenance from her ex-husband who is a prison officer. The couple has two children.The cop, Gladys Marega said Bulawayo Prison officer Panganayi Nehuma must contribute towards the upkeep of their two children aged six and one year. I want Nehuma to help me to raise our children who are aged six and one. They need school fees, food, clothes and I also need money to pay rent, said the police officer.Nehuma said he could not afford to pay $150 because he earns just $204 after deductions. The money that she is demanding is too much, I can afford $50 per month because I ve loan deductions which leave me with $204. The reason why l took the loan it s because of her. One day when l arrived from work l found our house empty. She took everything including my clothes, he said.Maintenance Court Magistrate Manasa Musiiwa ordered the prison officer to pay $80 monthly for the upkeep of his children. @cynthiamthembo1.
