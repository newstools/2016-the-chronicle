The Zimbabwe select training squad has been divided into two, with the Southern Region based players set to train at Hartsfield on Tuesdays and Thursdays under Nyamutsamba, while national team coach Cyprian Mandenge will be in charge of the Northern Region players. At a later date, the squad will then train for about a week together and we hope to see a number of players from the south making the final team that will tour Hong Kong next month, said Dangah.Nechironga, who scored a penalty kick, a try and a conversion, is likely to make it into the squad with ease.Fullback Andrea Banda, a try scorer for Southern Select, Nduwa, Machanjaire, Ndebele and Mackay are also tipped to make the Sables squad.
