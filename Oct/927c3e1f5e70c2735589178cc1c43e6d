Obviously things won t happen overnight, because everything is a process. I will leave no stone unturned in the endeavour to get good results. I have lots to work on and will focus on privately working on players limitations. We ll try to get right combinations, because we need guys who will consolidate and attack, said Streak.Makhaya Ntini, who was interim head coach since Whatmore&#8217;s departure and oversaw Zimbabwe&#8217;s limited overs series against India and the two Tests against New Zealand reverts back to his bowling coach job, while Lance Klusener continues as batting consultant. To have three international players in the national team change room is good for Zimbabwe Cricket. Makahaya will continue as the bowling coach, with Lance doing the batting part. We will collectively work together. I will lend my experience since I m an all-rounder and my knowledge of players will also work in our favour, said Streak.More to follow
