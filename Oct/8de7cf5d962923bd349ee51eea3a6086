3D, Organisers of the eventBongani Ndlovu, Showbiz CorrespondentAFTER the success of the initial reopening of Kudu Bar earlier this year, 3D Events have decided to open the bar again for one night only. The once famous bar located at Hartsfield Tshisanyama will be opened next week Saturday on a night which has been dubbed: Remember Kudu Part 2 .Mduduzi Mdlongwa, one of the guys behind the opening, said the success and response they got from the initial reopening had forced them to do it again. The event will be an All Black Party where we want people to converge in their numbers and reminisce about the good old days at the city s once illustrious bar, said Mdlongwa. We want to afford those who missed the first reopening another chance. He said the party would be hosted by comedian-cum-MC Babongile Sikhonjwa with DJs Victor Bravo, Liz, Staffa, Slimza, Crazy Black Wellyonz, Frosty and Razz Obido on the decks. Entry has been pegged at $10.Revellers will be expected to attend the party clad in all black, a colour theme which has been determined by the drink of the night Johnny Walker Black Label which will be on special. The party will also be a way for patrons to mark the beginning of the festive season and start preparing for it, said Mdlongwa.He said the attendance would determine whether the club would be opened full time. The remember Kudu event is a way for us to see if people are interested in the reopening of the bar in the future. If the numbers are good, we ll consider reopening forever. @bonganinkunzi.
