Cde Joseph TshumaMashudu Netsianda, Senior Reporter ZANU-PF MP for Mpopoma-Pelandaba Cde Joseph Tshuma yesterday slammed political leaders in Matabeleland for lacking guts to speak out on important issues affecting the region. Cde Tshuma made the remarks during the distribution of an additional 3 000 day-old chicks to residents in his constituency.The chicks were donated by Vice-President Phelekezela Mphoko and were handed over to the beneficiaries by his wife Mrs Laurinda Mphoko.Cde Tshuma said the silence by political leaders in the region on issues affecting Matabeleland contributed to its economic woes. We have leaders in Matabeleland who cannot articulate the challenges faced by their people. Matabeleland is marginalised largely because as leaders in the region we are actually failing to highlight problems in the region. How do you expect President Mugabe who is the appointing authority to know all the challenges facing us if they are not brought to his attention? he asked.Cde Tshuma urged leaders in Matabeleland to emulate VP Mphoko who is spearheading development in the region. VP Mphoko has come up with several projects to empower people and we ought to take a leaf from that. It is incumbent upon us as leaders to make noise about these challenges because as leaders we should thrive to alleviate poverty, he said.VP Mphoko unveiled the poultry project three months ago. The programme which is anchored on the country s economic blueprint, Zim-Asset,seeks to empower communities through utilising local resources. We as MPs interact with ministers in Parliament and we need to approach them and tell them about our programmes and challenges, he said.VP Mphoko will next Sunday donate another batch of chicks to residents in the same constituency. The chicks were sourced from commercial farmer Mr Peter Cunningham who owns Maleme Farm in Matobo. @mashnets
