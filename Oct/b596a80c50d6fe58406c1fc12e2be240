There is a need for local flower growers to keep abreast with state of-the-art production practices as well as marketing techniquesTHE recently announced measures in the Mid-term fiscal policy-2016 to eliminate export permits in the horticultural sector provide an opportunity for cut flower growers. There is a need for local flower growers to keep abreast with state of-the-art production practices as well as marketing techniques.In this regard, ZimTrade encourages them to interact with the Zimbabwe Trade Information Portal (Smart tools and trade map) in order to obtain information on the latest trends.To convert the opportunity into real business, there is need for immediate implementation of the measures to compliment the export development and promotion initiatives being spearheaded by ZimTrade.The removal of export permits is expected to improve the export competitiveness of local flower produce, through reduction of costs associated with regulation documents, long waiting periods of processing licenses and approvals as well as exhaustive processing of export documentation.In 2002, Zimbabwe was the second largest exporter of cut flowers in Africa, after Kenya, exporting as much as US$60 million worth of cut flowers globally. However, latest statistics indicate that the country s exports of cut flowers declined by 95 percent to a mere US$3,1 million in 2015.Zimbabwe generally has the ideal natural conditions for the growing of cut flowers. Historically, about 70 percent of Zimbabwe s flower exports came from the Banket, Concession, Glendale, Bindura, Harare, Goromonzi, Trelawney, and Kwekwe areas, mostly growing Roses. Other flowers included Proteas, Asters and Chrysanthemums.The Netherlands has remained Zimbabwe s largest export destination for cut flowers, importing an average of 69 percent of the country s cut flowers in the last 15 years.Meanwhile, ZimTrade will host this year edition of the Exporters Conference and Exporter of the Year Awards on 20 October 2016, at the Meikles Hotel in Harare.This year s conference will be held under the theme, Maximising Competitive Advantage to Drive Export-Led Growth .The Exporter of the Year Awards, whose objective is to acknowledge and appreciate the efforts by companies who managed to continue exporting despite the difficult operating environment, will be held in the evening of the same day.Over 200 stakeholders from existing and emerging exporters Government, Industry lobby organisation, development Cooperation partners and trade support institutions are expected to attend the event.Zimtrade has also developed an easy to use too for local enterprises, including SMEs, to assess their readiness before they venture into export business. The tool, known as the Export Readiness Checker , is accessible on the Zimbabwe Trade Information Portal (TIP), tradezimbabwe.com.An export ready enterprise stands better prepared to fully explore opportunities in foreign markets while neutralising the inherent risks of cross border business. The tool allows current and potential exporters to identify and analyse areas where they need to improve in order to develop and grow their exports.The assessment focuses on areas such as management commitment, financial resources, market selection, product adaptation, export experience, among others. It identifies areas for capacity development and is, therefore, key in assisting to develop an effective export marketing plan.-Extracted from Zimtrade latest newsletter
