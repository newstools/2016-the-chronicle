Florence Ncube, Chronicle Reporter A MAGISTRATE has given a driver at the Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (Zinara), who owes $1 000 in maintenance arrears, 24 hours to pay the money while remanding him in custody. Collin Tshuma (44) of DRC houses in Empumalanga in Hwange failed to pay $50 monthly maintenance for his six-year-old daughter until the money accumulated to $1000.He told Victoria Falls Magistrate Ms Lindiwe Maphosa yesterday that he lost his estranged girlfriend s contacts and banking details when he was transferred from Hwange to Masvingo.The magistrate remanded him in custody and ordered him to bring the money on his next appearance today.Tshuma pleaded guilty to failure to pay maintenance and begged the court to give him time to sell some bricks to raise the money.The magistrate said Tshuma disrespected a court order. Are you telling this court that for one year you couldn t look for any means of getting in touch with the complainant or your daughter? Are you aiming to irritate this court because you can be sent to prison for that, said Ms Maphosa.Tshuma unsuccessfully tried to convince the court to give him a grace period to pay and even suggested that the money be garnished from his salary.Prison guards led a handcuffed Tshuma out of the courtroom into the holding cells as he continued to plead with the magistrate. @hurricaneflo
