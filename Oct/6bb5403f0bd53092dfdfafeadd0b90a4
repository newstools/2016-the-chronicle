Zimbabwean pugilist Elvis MoyoRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter DESPITE losing the Extreme Fighting Championship (EFC) heavyweight title fight to South African Andrew van Zyl on Saturday night, Zimbabwean pugilist Elvis Moyo is pleased with his performance and is hopeful of a comeback. He lost through a technical knockout in the fourth minute of the last round after Van Zyl managed to mount the Bulawayo Bomber ensuring he wasn t able to land killer blows with his elbows.Moyo looked set to win the bout, having earlier landed heavy punches on his opponent, who was waiting for a chance for the takedown at Sun City in Rustenburg, South Africa. It was a great fight and I made a small mistake at a crucial stage which cost me the match. If you look at the destruction I caused on Andrew, you ll appreciate how dangerous I am and how lucky he was to win, said Moyo. If he was someone else, he would have been out of there the moment I touched him. I m happy with the way I performed and I m looking forward to my next fight, as I start another journey towards a title fight. It took Moyo 10 matches, seven wins and three defeats, to get a title fight.Moyo said Van Zyl did his homework ahead of the weekend bout. Andrew is good on the ground, as he is a clinch specialist. He tried on a number of times to get me, but I was alert and landed lots of punches on him. The way I hit him he could hardly walk after the fight and had lots of bruises and a bloodied face. I guess the fans got value for their money, Moyo said.Van Zyl described Moyo as an animal and praised him for a great fight. What an animal, what a great fight, thank you Elvis Moyo, Van Zyl said after the match. After the crazy weekend, I would just like to say thank you to Elvis. That was a tough fight and you were a great opponent, probably the best challenge I have had in my career. Head up big man, your chance will come again. Much love and respect, he said.@ZililoR.
