Wynne Zanamwe, Midlands Reporter A 61-YEAR-OLD-MAN from Kwekwe was recently arrested for allegedly raping his 11-year-old granddaughter in a bush. The old man, a resident of Amaveni suburb in Kwekwe, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the minor, appeared before Gokwe Magistrate, Mr Maturure facing rape charges.He pleaded not guilty and was remanded out of custody to October 16 on $50 bail.In his defence, the man said he was surprised to receive a call from the girl s mother accusing him of raping her daughter. Your Worship, I do not admit to the allegation, I only gave the complainant $3 which she was sent to collect from me by her mother while I was in the field. I do not know what happened to her thereafter, he said. I was surprised to receive a phone call from the complainant s mother saying that she had not reached home and I then assisted her to search for the complainant. Prosecuting, Mr Mike Mhene said on September 17, the girl was sent by her mother to collect some money from her grandfather.When she arrived at the fields she found the accused and told him that her mother had sent her for some money. The accused instead allegedly raped her once and gave her 25 cents to buy jiggies.He allegedly threatened to stab her with a knife if she disclosed the crime. The complainant was admitted to Kwekwe Hospital for three days after the assault since she sustained severe injuries on her private parts, said Mhene. @wynnezane.
