Wonesai Chimwanambo.Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya, ShowBiz Correspondent SINCE the age of 11, music has been a talent that has been manifesting as a dream for Wonesai Chimwanambo. It is only recently when the 38-year-old up-and-coming gospel musician finally managed to record a six-track gospel album which she named Mbiri Kuna Jesu.The album in which the musician acknowledges the power of God is a worship journey and a praise fete. Judging from the album title Mbiri Kuna Jesu one can tell that this is my way of thanking God who endowed me with the talent to sing and dance, Chimwanambo said.Tracks like Number 1, Tapi Tapi and Kushungurudza are fast paced unique contemporary gospel numbers that are defined by deep preaching. Chimwanambo s smooth humble voice makes the songs more appealing.What makes the album even more intriguing is that the artiste features her daughter, Tatenda, who through her vocal prowess, brings a youthful fliar into all the songs. My mother and father were musicians. My husband and children are also into music. That s why I included my daughter who s slowly following my steps as she was part of this album and added something special. Chimwanambo said the album that was released last month in Bulawayo has sold close to 300 copies, something she feels reflects that people are appreciating her music.Like many budding artistes, Chimwanambo faces financial constraints that are crippling her dream to record more albums. I ve close to 100 and counting, songs that I m yet to record. This has been a journey that started when I was 11 so if I manage to get sponsors, I ll certainly realise my dream, she said.Asked where people could get her music, the artiste said she was yet to contract a distribution company. For now, I m marketing and selling my music on the streets alone.
