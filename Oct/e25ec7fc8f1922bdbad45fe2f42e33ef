Wynne Zanamwe, Midlands Reporter LOCAL paint manufacturer, Nash Paints, has embarked on an expansion drive aimed at increasing production of domestic and automotive paints to about 400 000 litres and 100 000 litres per month respectively. The manufacturing company has new products to offer such as automated tinting system, wood line products among others.In an interview, Nash Paints Technical Manager Mr Kudakwashe Chemhuru said the company, which produces 40 percent of its products locally, is set to open its plant by the end of November this year in Granite side, Harare. We have a new factory that should be operational by the end of November in Granite side, we are only left with the health safety aspect and we are looking forward to be accredited by SARS and ISOL. We now have the means and capacity to produce our own automotive paints and currently we are the leading manufacturer of automotive paints, said Mr Chemhuru. Nash Paints is set to create employment for locals and is currently on a graduate trainee programme, which targets local painters.We now have a well trained technical team, which means we will no longer be distributing automotive paints from other companies and we have also started a graduate trainee programme where we mentor graduates on different aspects. It is a one year programme based on performance and we are targeting normal painters, city council, public works among others so that we conscientise them more on paints. He said Nash Paints was taking the training programme to all parts of the country starting with Gweru. @wynnezane
