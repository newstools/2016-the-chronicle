We met and came up with six names. The applicants will be interviewed this Friday after which the substantive chief executive officer will be announced, said Sibanda.He could not be drawn into divulging the names of their prospective CEO, saying: I can t reveal the names because that may put unnecessary pressure on the candidates. What you have to know is that these are the best and it s a mixture of locals and foreigners. However, please bear with us; we will let you know the name of the new CEO after the interviews. However, sources told Chronicle Sport that former National Football Association of Swaziland (NFAS) chief executive officer and ex-Mamelodi Sundowns general manager Kenneth Makhanya, who is presently working for South African National First Division side Black Leopards, is among the six short-listed candidates.The others include former Dynamos treasurer Eric Mvududu, ex-PSL finance and administration manager Cuthbert Mutandwa, acting Zifa general secretary Joseph Mamutse and administrator Nkululeko Ndlovu.Warriors striker Nyasha Mushekwi s ex-wife Luminista, who was once described as a genius by Zifa president Phillip Chiyangwa, may also be in line for the general secretary post. Luminista is a holder of a degree in sports marketing.Educationist and veteran administrator Elkanah Dube, who had applied for the position, is believed to have pulled out of the race due to other commitments.In an advertisement flighted last month, Zifa indicated that it was looking for a person in possession of a commercial degree or relevant sports management degree, while an MBA would be an added advantage.The duties of the general secretary include implementing decisions passed by the Zifa congress and the executive committee, organising meetings for the congress, executive committee, standing committees and secretarial services.
