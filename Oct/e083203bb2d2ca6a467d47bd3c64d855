Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter A second half goal by Victor Moyo handed FBC Falcons maximum points as they edged United FC 1-0 in a Bulawayo Amateur Football Association (Bafa) League clash yesterday. The left-back headed home the winner in the 79th minute when he pounced on a rebound after United defenders failed to deal with a well taken corner kick by left winger Whisper Mujokoro.The first half was a dull encounter, with very few goal scoring opportunities being created.The first real attempt came seven minutes into the second half when Mujokoro s free-kick hit the post before being cleared out of the danger area.Mujokoro was used as an impact player following his brace in their 3-1 win that ended Rebels FC s 20-game winning streak in the league a fortnight ago.His exceptional pace made him a menace to defenders.United tried to fight their way back into the game, but were unable to create any decent scoring chances as Falcons held on for the win.Falcons coach Kudzai Mhandire said he was not convinced with his team s performance. The game was good, but not convincing. It was just a lukewarm match with both teams not showing enough intent to score. This is probably due to the fact that we didn t train mid-week as we had attended a funeral. Our assistant coach lost his mother so we had to support the family in this difficult time, said Mhandire.Meanwhile, Laduma atoned for last week s 2-0 defeat in the Townshend and Butcher Cup final with a 7-0 thumping of Securico.Mpilo FC were awarded three points since their weekend opponents Madamara were expelled from the league last week.Eleven Warriors lost 1-2 to Anolle Castings, while Nga Chronicle beat Safe Guard 2-0. Dynamic Diesel suffered a 0-3 defeat to Crusaders.Rebels were involved in a high-scoring 5-3 win over Vipers. Seven Warriors beat Unity Village 1-0.@khumzallen
