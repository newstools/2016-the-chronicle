He has abandoned his daughter and before we came here, I tried several times to talk to him about the upkeep of the child and he told me he can only give me $1. He said he could only afford to buy bread and even told me to buy from a nearby tuck-shop, said Ms Moyo.In response, Mpofu said he resides with his elder brother because he has no money. At the restaurant where I m employed, I only get tips which amount to about $6 per week. I can t afford to buy food and I eat at my workplace during the day and sleep at my brother s place, he said.Mpofu said he doubted he was the little girl s father and demanded DNA tests to be conducted.
