Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent LAST year s StarBrite winner Novuyo Seagirl Dube &#8211; gave birth to a baby boy at Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo on Monday. Her manager, Michelle Madau, said the afro-pop musician, who gave birth to her first child through a caesarean operation, was expected out of hospital next week. Seagirl and her son are doing well and we re so excited. I don t know the surname of the father but she has named the baby Thandolwethu, which means our love, said Madau.She said Thandolwethu s father (who she claimed not to know) is permanently resident in the United Kingdom and could not make it to Zimbabwe when the baby was born. Other than the father of the baby, Seagirl is being supported by her mother and band members who include her twin sister, Ntombiyolwandle Dube. Madau said she could not wait for Seagirl to recover. I want her back on stage and also in studio. With the new baby, this might be a challenge, but I know she s a strong person who ll soon bounce back on the showbiz scene. Apart from winning StarBrite in 2015, Dube is the lead vocalist for One Stand band. She has worked with Sandra Ndebele s Intombi Zomqangala, Umoja CFC and BaShupi among many other renowned performers.
