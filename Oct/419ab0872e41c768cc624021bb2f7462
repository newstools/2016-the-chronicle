VP MnangagwaPaidamoyo Chipunza, Harare Bureau THE Government is appealing to development partners for collaboration in the agriculture and agro-industry value chain sectors to ensure food and nutrition security for its citizens, Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said. In a speech read on his behalf by Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Christopher Mushohwe in Harare yesterday, VP Mnangagwa said while the country had made significant progress in attainment of universal primary education, gender equality and empowerment of women and combating HIV and Aids, malaria and other diseases, more still needed to be done to reduce poverty.He said there was therefore a need to vigorously support the agriculture sector to improve productivity in line with Zim-Asset and the 10 Point Plan. Let me take this opportunity to invite and exhort all potential partners of immense possibilities for collaboration existing in Zimbabwe s agriculture sector and along the agro-industry value chain, said VP Mnangagwa.He said Government was committed to ensure food and nutrition security for its citizens as outlined in the national Constitution regardless of political persuasion or affiliation.Apart from the agriculture sector, VP Mnangagwa said the country must also continue its efforts to reduce maternal mortality and the burden of HIV, put in place effective social protection measures, improve the quality of the education system and continue efforts in women economic empowerment.VP Mnangagwa said Government would also prioritise strengthening mobilisation and targeted effective utilisation of domestic resources to complement efforts by development partners and other well wishers since illegal sanctions imposed on the country were hurting the economy thereby constraining the country to achieve Agenda 2030 goals. Despite the current limited fiscal space we are experiencing, domestic resource mobilisation anchored on sustained economic growth and supported by an enabling macroeconomic environment, is the key means of financing the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, he said.Speaking at the same occasion, UN resident coordinator Mr Bishow Parajuli, said the UN family together with its developmental partners and the international community would continue to mobilise support for Zimbabwe.He said in their collaborative response to the prevailing drought situation, they have so far mobilised about $191 million out of an appeal of $352 million.Mr Parajuli said this assistance had reached out to 1,5 million people who were in greater need of food assistance and was expected to reach out to over three million people at the peak of the lean season. Our assistance is targeted to the most vulnerable communities in line with the universal humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, independence and impartiality, he said.&nbsp;
