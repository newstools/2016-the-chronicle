Showbiz Reporter LADIES in Bulawayo will be treated to rare entertainment tonight as Private Lounge has invited male strippers to tantalise and titillate them. The invitation of the male dancers comes after an outcry from female patrons of the strip joint who had been complaining that there was not much entertainment for them. Thelma Zuva, the club s manager, said the event, which has been dubbed Ladies Night was long overdue. We ve been getting many requests from women that we invite male strippers. I m glad we ve heeded that call and can assure the ladies that it s going to be a party like no other. She said a lot of freebies have been set aside for the event, which if successful, will be held each week. A lot of competitions will be held with best female dancers and best dressed set to win prizes. Since this is a strip club, we won t have singing competitions, but those to do with lap dances and stripping, said Zuva. Women in heels will get free entry into the club while male patrons will be expected to part with $3. A partnership between the club and Afdis will see lucky women getting Sting ciders for free. The club s vixens will also be on standby with new acts.Meanwhile, Private Lounge has embraced the use of plastic money by introducing a Point of sale swipe machine for their customers convenience. With this credit crunch, we found it convenient to introduce a swipe machine so that people have no hustle looking for money to buy their drinks as they can simply swipe for them in the club. For now, the machine only takes ZimSwitch cards as we re still working on getting one which will accept visa cards.
