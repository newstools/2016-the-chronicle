Fairness Moyana, Hwange Correspondent A 14-YEAR-OLD Dete school girl who was facing two counts of unlawful entry and theft claimed she stole from one of her victims to punish him after he slept with her and refused to pay. The Form Two pupil (name withheld) told provincial magistrate Mrs Rose Dube that she stole from the male complainant to recover $50 which he had promised to give her after the two had sex. Your worship, I stole from the first complainant because I was hungry and needed food and clothes to wear. As for the second complainant I did it to recover the money he had promised me after he slept with me and said he would give me $50 since I m an orphan, she said.Mrs Dube would have none of it. She cautioned the juvenile for her reckless behaviour and ordered her to concentrate on her school work. MrsDube suspended her sentence for the next five years on condition she does not commit a similar offence involving dishonesty.In addition she ordered the juvenile to undergo counselling with the Department of Social Services for three months.The court heard that on May 5 this year the teen went to Agnes Ncube, a Painted Dog Conservation assistant coordinator s place of residence in Dete and gained entry through an unlocked door, without permission.She looted property valued at $139 which included clothes and cooking oil before disappearing.On another occasion on May 18 she gained entry into Tapiwa Sithole s residence and took a satchel which she used to stash food stuffs, clothes and toiletries.She was however discovered and fled but the loot which included 2kg of sugar, rice and biscuits weighed her down resulting in her apprehension.Upon her arrest police recovered all the items valued at $50 stolen from Sithole s house. However, only $86 worth of Ncube s property was found. Ms Loveness Maseko appeared for the state.
