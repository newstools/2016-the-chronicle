Cynthia Dube, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO City Council (BCC) accountants clerk s bid to be awarded $1 300 in maintenance was turned down by a magistrate who reduced the amount to $280. Ms Blessing Mugari appeared in court seeking maintenance of $1 388 from her workmate, BCC systems analyst Phathisa Tshuma the father of her six-year-old son.She said her child was ill and needs financial support from Tshuma. I want him to support his child. Our child is ill and he needs a special nurse and maid, special food, and soap that he must use. I also need $200 to service the Toyota Corolla on a monthly basis. I need money to buy clothes and to pay school fees. I earn $900 per month Your Worship, I can t afford to support our child on my own while his father is earning $1 600 per month, said Ms Mugari.Tshuma said he could not afford to pay the money that was being claimed.He said he was contributing to the upkeep of his child. I have been paying hospital bills for our child and sometimes I pay school fees. I think Blessing has forgotten that she also has an obligation to maintain that child. Some of the things that she wants are unreasonable. For example, what type of a Corolla can require $200 for service every month? I think she just dragged me to court so that she can be milking money from me, said Tshuma.He said Ms Mugari told the court that she earns $900 and wondered if their son needs $2 200 per month for upkeep.Tshuma said he could only afford to pay $250 as he has other responsibilities which include paying $490 for house bills.Maintenance Court Magistrate Mr Manasa Musiiwa ordered Tshuma to pay $280 monthly. The application for garnishee order is hereby granted. The garnishee is hereby ordered to deduct $280 per month as maintenance for the upkeep of one minor child with effect from September 30, 2016. The respondent is further ordered to cater for the minor child s medical expenses and clothing when it would be required, he said. @cynthiamthembo1
