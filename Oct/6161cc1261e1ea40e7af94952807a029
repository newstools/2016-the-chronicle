Black Boots took the lead in the second half through Mitchel Guri, but Peace Kennedy levelled the scores.Hearts of Oak s Ntombiyelanga Ndlovu put her side in front before Sazisile Phiri s own goal ensured a share of the spoils.Hearts of Oak coach Evans Netha was not impressed with his team s performance despite the draw. We didn t play well this week. We lost possession easily and gave our opponents too much room in our half. We were better in the second half when our skipper Happy Gumbo started nice build-ups which saw us scoring two goals. Our goalkeeper Sharon Ngwenya really came to our rescue with her fine saves, said Netha. We go back to the drawing board to attend to a few things as we chase the championship. The road will not be easy because every team wants to beat us, but our target is not to lose any match until the season ends.
