Gilbert BandaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Warriors defender Gilbert Banda s soccer career could be over following a suspected Achilles tendon injury he sustained during Bantu Rovers 2-1 win over Bosso 90 at Luveve Stadium yesterday. Banda, who was in great form, winning all aerial balls, picked the injury in the 40th minute when Rovers were leading Bosso 90 2-0, and was replaced by Leslie Lunga.The former Highlanders and FC Platinum defender was taken to hospital after the game.Rovers general manager Wilbert Sibanda said they will only know the gravity of Banda s injury today. The team doctor and club physiotherapist suspected a torn Achilles tendon and we had to rush him to the hospital so that we get to know how bad his injury is. We re hoping his injury is not serious because Banda s experience is wanted in this championship race. Should he be ruled out for the remainder of the season, it will be a terrible blow for our campaign, said Sibanda.Rovers are at the top of the table with 50 points following yesterday s victory.The former Premiership side got their goals from Fortune Nkomazana, who rose high to head in a Bukhosi Sibanda seventh minute cross from the left.Obrey Chirinda doubled Rovers lead in the 35th minute after being sent through by Nkomazana, who opted to leave the ball for the former instead of going for glory.Bosso 90 got their consolation goal from Brian Bhebhe in the 81st minute after he beat an offside trap to get to the end of a Ray Lunga defence-splitting pass.Rovers coach Johannes Ngodzo was happy with the victory. We had to bounce back after last week s 1-2 loss to Indlovu Iyanyathela. The guys really showed the zeal to win and we will try and work harder to correct the few mistakes we made, said Ngodzo.His Bosso 90 counterpart Melusi Sibanda said: We paid dearly for the mistakes we made in the first half, but I m proud of my boys for fighting hard. We ll go back to the drawing board and work on our errors.
